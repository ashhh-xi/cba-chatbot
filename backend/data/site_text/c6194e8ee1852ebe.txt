                                    What is Gap cover and how does it work? 

Gap cover helps to pay the difference when your building sum insured amount isn't enough to cover a claim. For example, if your building sum insured is $500,000 and the cost of repairs is $600,000 you may be paid up to an additional 25% of your sum insured amount to cover the difference.

                                    Does Home Insurance cover my property if I rent it out with Airbnb? 

Home Insurance does not cover short term rentals. Instead, you can consider 
Landlord Insurance
.

When your property isn't your primary residence and is used as an Investment property home with short-term rental arrangements in place such as Airbnb or Stayz etc, cover can be provided under Landlord Insurance as a Holiday or Seasonal rental property.

Some restrictions and exclusions apply, read the 
Landlord Insurance PDS
 for more details.

                                    What does 'excess' mean for my insurance claim?

An excess is an amount you must pay when your insurance claim is accepted and agreed to be paid out. All excess amounts will be shown on your Certificate of Insurance.  

When an excess applies, you must pay your Basic excess plus any applicable additional excess(es).

A lower Basic excess may lower your cost if you have a claim, but will lead to a higher premium 

If you select a higher Basic excess, it may lower your premium but will cost more if you have a claim.

Cover and benefits are subject to eligibility criteria and terms and conditions, including the limits and exclusions of the insurance policy -
