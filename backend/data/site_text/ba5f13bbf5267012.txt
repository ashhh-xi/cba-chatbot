Frequently asked questions

                                    What are some of the benefits of home electrification?

Home electrification offers several benefits, it may reduce energy costs, decrease your home’s carbon footprint, and improve your home’s comfort.

                                    Who do I talk to if something goes wrong during the installation or post-installation?

For issues related to your solar panels, home batteries or EV chargers, please talk with the relevant vendor or company you are engaged with.

                                    Can I trust the selected providers CommBank is working with?

We only work with providers and installers that comply with the 
New Energy Tech Approved Seller code

Clean Energy Council
 (CEC) or 
Solar Accreditation Australia
 approved installers.

                                    How can I ensure the quality of my eligible energy-efficient purchases?

It’s your responsibility to ensure that you’re satisfied with the quality of your eligible energy-efficient purchases. If you detect substandard workmanship or materials, or have any disputes with your retailer and/or installer, you should speak with them as soon as possible. Depending on the severity of the matter, you may also need to inform your solicitor.

Once you’ve reviewed your quotes and accept your package with Brighte, you’ll be directed back to CommBank via a unique link to review your financing options and begin your application for the product that best suits your needs.

Comparison rates are calculated based on an unsecured loan of $30,000, over a term of five years. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate.

Additional repayments made on a fixed rate and secured fixed rate car loans are not available to be redrawn. An early repayment adjustment is charged if loan is fully repaid with 12 or more months remaining on loan term, and we reasonably estimate we will incur a loss or administrative cost. View the 
Personal Loan Terms and Conditions

An excellent credit history is determined by, among other things, paying your bills and making loan repayments on or ahead of time, being disciplined with your credit applications, and not overextending yourself financially.

Actions which can negatively impact your credit history include missing bill or loan repayments, defaulting on your credit facility, or making a large number of credit applications in a short period of time. You can find out more about how your credit score is calculated and tips for improving your credit score at our 
Credit Score Information Hub
