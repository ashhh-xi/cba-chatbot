PDS
.

                                    I have more than one dog or cat. Can they be covered under the same policy?

Please note that each insured pet needs to have their own policy.

There are a few questions you’ll be asked about your new family member, so it’s best if you go through this application process over the phone by calling 
1300 913 575
. 

                                    Are there age limits for pet insurance?

Your dog or cat must be older than eight weeks and younger than nine years at the time you first apply for pet insurance.

                                    Does pet insurance cover desexing?

If you have Routine Care (non-insurance benefit), PetSure will provide a contribution towards the cost(s) of any of the specified Routine Care items, which includes desexing, subject to the Routine Care limits.

                                    Do you offer pet dental insurance?

Both Classic Cover and Plus Cover do not provide reimbursement for any cover related to dental conditions unless it is a traumatic tooth fracture under Specified Accidental Injury cover.

You can add Booster Care cover to your policy and get cover for treatment of specified dental conditions like gingivitis, up to the Booster Care limit of $2,000.
3

Treatment of specified dental conditions included:

Gingivitis

Abscesses

Removal of teeth where medically necessary due to dental disease arising from infection, retained deciduous teeth, cavities or fractured teeth

You can also receive a contribution for pet teeth cleaning if you add optional Routine Care (non-insurance benefit) to your policy (subject to the Routine Care limit). 

                                    What is my pet insurance excess?

An excess means an amount you contribute towards the cost of your claim(s), as shown on your certificate of insurance.

The excess is calculated on a ‘per condition, per policy period’ basis. PetSure does this for each condition treated that is unrelated to any other condition during the same policy period.

The excess will be deducted from your calculated claim benefits after PetSure applies any benefit percentage, benefit limit, sub-limit (if any) and Booster Care limit (where applicable) to your claimed amount.

You can choose a $0 or $200 excess with Classic Cover or Plus Cover. 

                                    How can pet insurance help me?

Medical treatment for your dog or cat can cost thousands, should they get injured or become sick.

Pet insurance can help cover the costs of eligible veterinary expenses so you can focus on your pet's recovery.

To help you understand whether this product is right for you, refer to the 
PDS
.

                                    What doesn’t pet insurance include?

Pet insurance covers an extensive range of specified accidents and illnesses.

There are some general exclusions such as pre-existing conditions, dental procedures (unless you have Booster Care), elective treatments and procedures, breeding or obstetrics and routine or preventative treatments (unless you have Routine Care (non-insurance benefit)).

Refer to the 
PDS
 for a full list of what isn’t covered.

                                    How can I reduce my premium?

Pet insurance offers two cover options, Classic Cover and Plus Cover, with annual benefit limits of either $15,000 or $30,000 respectively. Each cover includes a choice of excess ($0 or $200) and benefit percentage (70%, 80% or 90%) to help meet your needs.
4

Your premium is impacted by the excess or benefit percentage you choose. For example, a higher excess and a lower benefit percentage will have a lower premium but higher out of pocket costs at claim time. Conversely, a lower excess and a higher benefit percentage will have a higher premium but lower out of pocket costs at claim time.
4

Please note there are other factors used to calculate your premium. Please consider the 
PDS
 for more information.  

                                    Will my premium increase every year?  

Yes, your premium will generally increase each year. 

Just like humans, the older our pets get, the more likely they are to have health hiccups. Cats and dogs age faster than humans do, which means that their veterinary treatment costs typically go up rapidly each year too. As a result, the cost of insuring your pet will increase as your pet ages. 

Also, the overall cost of medical treatment for pets has increased in recent years, due to the increased availability of medical treatments and technology-enabled services and ongoing demand for these services. The treatment options and advancements in technology are providing us with great opportunities to give our pets a great quality of life for longer. 

While this is great news for the care of our pets, these treatments come at a significant cost. Year-on-year treatment costs increase, and this is factored into the cost of pet insurance. 

Refer to the 
PDS
 for more information about calculation of premiums.
