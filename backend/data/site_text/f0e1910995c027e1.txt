FAQs

                                    How do I decide which car insurance policy is best for me?

Choosing the right car insurance policy depends on various factors, including your individual needs, budget, and the level of coverage you require. Here are some tips to help you decide:

1. Assess your needs: consider factors such as the value of your vehicle, your driving habits and your financial situation. Determine the level of coverage you need based on these factors.

2. Consider affordability: evaluate the cost of premiums and any applicable excesses. Find a balance between the coverage provided and what you can afford.

3. Look for optional extras: many policies will come with optional extras you may be able to add to your insurance, such as roadside assistance. Consider which of these are important to you and look for policies which may offer cover for these.

                                    What is an excess in car insurance?

An excess is an amount you must pay when your claim is accepted and agreed to be paid out. All excess amounts will be shown on your Certificate of Insurance.  

When an excess applies, you must pay your Basic excess plus any applicable additional excess(es).

A lower Basic excess may save you more if you have a claim, but may lead to a higher premium

A higher Basic excess may save you more on your premiums, but may cost more if you have a claim

For more details, refer to 
PDS
 and 
PEDG
.

                                    What happens to my insurance if I sell my car and buy a new one?

If you replace your car with another car during your period of insurance, you'll be given up to 14 consecutive days of temporary cover for your replacement car.

The temporary cover applying to your replacement car will be:

The same cover type noted on your Certificate of Insurance

For up to 14 days from the time you replaced your car with another car, or until the expiry date of your current period of insurance, whichever comes first

You must contact 
13 1361
 before the end of the 14 days for cover over the new car to continue.

                                    Do I need to list my child as a driver if they drive the car occasionally?

Anyone who is a regular driver should be listed on the policy as a ‘declared driver’. However, Learner drivers do not need to be listed until they obtain their ‘P’ plates. 

Call 
13 1361
 to add additional drivers to your policy. 

                                    Does Car Insurance cover me if I'm driving Uber?

Car Insurance does not cover you for driving Uber or other ride sharing services. 

                                    Am I covered if I have an accident and have an international driver's licence?

Yes, you’ll be covered if the international driver’s licence is current and is recognised by Australian law as valid for driving in Australia.

                                    How can I include more than one driver on my insurance policy?

The policyholder can call 
13 1361
 to add more drivers. You’ll need the following information for all drivers:

Name, gender and date of birth

At what age they got their full driver’s license

Driving, claim and criminal history.

Adding more drivers might change your premium and the excesses payable at the time of a claim.

                                    Can I get insurance for my electric (EV) or hybrid car?

You can get insurance for EVs and hybrids provided they meet underwriting guidelines

                                    What is car insurance? 

Car insurance provides cover if your car causes damage to someone else’s property if you are responsible and, depending on the level of cover you choose, provides cover for the repair or replacement of your car when it is stolen or damaged. The level of cover your car has is dependent on the type of cover you choose.

                                    Is there a time limit on car insurance claims in Australia?
