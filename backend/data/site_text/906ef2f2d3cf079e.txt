Frequently asked questions

                                    What is refinancing a home loan?

Refinancing  involves switching your home loan from one lender to another by taking out a new mortgage to replace your existing one. This usually also includes different and/ or a new set of terms and conditions.

                                    How do I refinance a home loan?

The process of refinancing a home loan includes assessing your current loan, comparing new loan options to best suit your individual needs, calculating potential savings, and applying for the new loan. Refinancing could potentially help you save money, pay off your mortgage faster, or better manage your finances. 

You can apply online or refinance with 
Digi home loan
. Alternately, you can book an appointment with 
Home Lending Specialists
.

                                    Is refinancing a good idea?

Refinancing your home loan can be a good idea, depending on  your individual circumstances and financial goals. Here are some factors to consider:

Lower Interest Rates:
 If current interest rates are lower than what you're paying on your existing loan, refinancing could reduce your monthly repayments and save you money over the life of the loan

Change Loan Terms:
 Refinancing allows you to change the terms and conditions of your loan. For example, you might switch and extend your loan from a 15-year loan to a 30-year loan.

Access Equity:
 If your property has increased in value, refinancing can allow you to access the equity in your home for other financial needs, such as renovations or debt consolidation.

Cost and Fees:
 Consider the costs associated with refinancing, such as application fees, valuation fees, and legal fees. Ensure that the savings from refinancing outweigh these costs

Long-Term Plans: 
Think about how long you plan to stay in your home. If you plan to move soon, the costs of refinancing may not be worth it.

Ultimately, refinancing could be beneficial if it aligns with your financial goals and provides significant savings. It's a good idea to use tools like our refinance calculator and speak with a 
Home Lending Specialist
 to determine if it's the right move for you.

                                    When should you refinance a home loan?

It’s generally recommended to wait at least 12 to 24 months before refinancing. This is because refinancing involves costs such as application fees, valuation fees, and potential break costs if you're on a fixed-rate loan. Waiting allows you to build up equity in your property and ensures that the benefits of refinancing outweigh the associated costs. Additionally, refinancing too soon could impact your credit score.

                                    How often can you refinance a home loan?

Technically, you can refinance your home loan as often as you like, but it's important to consider the costs and benefits each time. Generally, it's recommended to review your loan annually. Frequent refinancing can incur fees and impact your credit score, so it's crucial to ensure that the savings and benefits outweigh the costs

If you're unsure, our 
Home Lending Specialists
 can help you determine the best timing for your situation.

 We charge the Rate Lock Fee when we process your request. It is therefore important that you have sufficient funds in your nominated account. The Rate Lock feature only applies to new Fixed Rate home loan and Fixed Rate Investment home loan applications. Rate Lock does not apply to Home Seekers, switching, splitting, top-ups, loan purpose transfers or repayment changes.

 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 10 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

Information provided (including interest rates) are subject to change.

Calculations are estimates provided as a guide only. They assume interest rates don’t change over the life of the loan and are calculated on the rate that applies for the initial period of the loan. Interest rates referenced are current rates and may change at any time.

Fees and charges are payable. The calculations do not take into account fees, charges or other amounts that may be charged to your loan (such as establishment or monthly service fees or stamp duty). Lenders' Mortgage Insurance or a Low Deposit Premium may apply to your loan depending on the size of your deposit; security, applicant and loan attributes. This is a one-off cost and will be added to the loan amount. Any of these additional amounts will increase repayments under the loan.

We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making interest only payments or principal and interest repayments. During an interest only period, your interest only payments won't reduce your loan balance. At the end of an interest only period, your repayments will increase to cover principal and interest components.

Rates are subject to change. Applications are subject to normal credit approval. Full terms and conditions will be included in our loan offer. Fees and charges are payable.

*
 Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25-year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5-year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed or guaranteed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed or guaranteed period. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.
