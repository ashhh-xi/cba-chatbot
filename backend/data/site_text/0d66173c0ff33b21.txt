Target Market Determinations

Target Market Determination (TMD)

What’s a Target Market Determination?

A Target Market Determination is a document which describes who a product is appropriate for (target market), and any conditions around how the product can be distributed to customers.

It also describes the events or circumstances where we may need to review the Target Market Determination for a financial product.

Why does CommBank need to have Target Market Determinations?

We’re required to have Target Market Determinations under the Design and Distribution Obligations under Pt 7.8A of the 
Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).

This is to make sure we’re keeping customers at the centre of our approach to the design and distribution of our financial products.
