Description of services and metrics:

Service availability %  
=  The actual amount of time that the service is not experiencing a 
significant 
outage, as a proportion of the amount of time during which the service was planned to be available in the quarter. Planned available time excludes planned outages (e.g. for system maintenance).

Significant outage
 = Unplanned unavailability of a service that meets minimum thresholds for duration and the proportion of customers affected.

System-wide infrastructures 
= Includes payment systems provided by the RBA, card schemes and other central payment system infrastructure; electricity network; and provider of telecommunications network links to CommBank’s operating or data centres.

Withdraw/deposit cash at ATM 
=

Ability to withdraw or deposit cash, and check account balance, at a CommBank-branded ATM. Excludes issues relating to the cardholder’s card.

Transact over-the-counter at a branch 
= Ability to withdraw or deposit cash, or initiate account transfers or make bill payments over-the-counter in a branch. Excludes the ability to draw and deposit cheques. Excludes Bank@Post outlets.

Make card payments (cardholders) 
=

Ability to use a CommBank-branded debit, prepaid or credit card to make a payment either in-store, on a mobile device (e.g. through an app) or online. Outages exclude problems with the business’ payments acceptance device or payments provider, or a customer’s mobile device.

Accept card payments (businesses) 
= Ability of businesses using the payment services of CommBank to accept card payments, either at point-of-sale or online/in-app. Outages exclude problems with the cardholder’s bank or payment acceptance devices that are not provided by CommBank.

Access accounts using online banking (web browser or mobile device app) 
=  Ability to log in, transfer between own accounts at CommBank, initiate payments and/or view accurate and up to date account information. Excludes the ability to process payments, which is covered in ‘make/receive account transfers - fast payments’ and ‘make/receive account transfers - next business day’.

Make/receive account transfers – fast payments
 = Ability of CommBank to process fast bank account transfers. This includes account-to-account transfers (Pay Anyone) to a PayID, and other one-off or scheduled payments (for example, direct debits and payroll payments by businesses) made through NPP/Osko. Outages exclude the inability for customers to initiate transfers due to unavailability of web or app banking channels, or a branch.

Make/receive account transfers – next business day 
= Ability of CommBank to process bank account transfers, with funds becoming available to the recipient on the next business day or later. Includes account-to-account transfers (Pay Anyone) and scheduled payments (for example, direct debits, and payroll payments by businesses) not made as fast payments through NPP/Osko, and BPAY payments. Outages exclude the inability to initiate payments due to unavailability of web or app banking channels, or a branch.
