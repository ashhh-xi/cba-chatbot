Loan term

Bridging loans have a maximum loan term of 12 months – so you need to sell and settle your current property within this timeframe.

Important things to know

Fees & availability

A Bridging Loan is not available on all home loans, and you may incur some fees and charges depending on your loan type.

Interest costs

A Bridging Loan is generally an Interest Only loan for the 12-month period. The longer it takes you to sell your current home, the longer you’ll be charged interest on the bridging finance. 

Timing

If you don’t sell your home in the agreed period, we may get involved to sell the property. We may also charge you a default interest rate above the annual percentage rate applying at the time or adjust the interest rate by removing any discretionary margin in place. You may be better off asking for an extended settlement period or selling your existing home first.

Frequently asked questions

                                    What is a bridging loan?

A bridging loan is a short-term loan that helps you buy a new property before you've sold your existing one. It covers the financial gap between the purchase of your new home and the sale of your current property. CommBank can offer eligible applicants bridging loans with a maximum term of 12 months, allowing you to avoid the hassle of renting or aligning settlement dates perfectly.

                                    How does a bridging loan work?

A bridging loan lets you purchase a new property before selling your current one by providing short-term financing. During the bridging period, which can last up to 12 months, you typically only pay interest on the loan. Once your existing property is sold, the proceeds are used to repay the bridging loan.

Things you should know

* An Everyday Offset is a transaction account linked to your eligible variable rate home loan or investment home loan. Money you put into your Everyday Offset reduces the balance on which we charge interest. No interest is earned on the balance of your Everyday Offset account, even if it exceeds the balance of the eligible home loan.

The target market for these products will be found within the product’s Target Market Determination,
