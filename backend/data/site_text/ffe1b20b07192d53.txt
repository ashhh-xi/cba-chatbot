CommBank and AIA

We believe financial wellbeing supports your overall wellbeing. That’s why we’ve partnered with AIA, who have more than 50 years’ experience protecting the lives of millions of Australians.

AIA aims to help Australians lead healthier, longer and better lives. Through our partnership, CommBank can refer customers to AIA Financial Wellbeing to seek financial advice.

They have access to a range of financial options and providers, with fees for a financial plan starting from $660 (including GST), and CommBank doesn’t receive a commission for referring you to AIA.

What is financial advice?

Financial advice is information and education to help you achieve your financial goals. This is provided by a qualified professional so you can feel confident in making decisions that support your financial wellbeing.

Your goals may vary depending on your needs and life stage, such as:

Building your wealth

How it works

An AIA Financial Wellbeing team member will talk to you to understand your financial situation, your needs and discuss how financial advice may benefit you. 

                                    1. Understanding your situation and goals

Start your journey by providing your details and answering a few questions followed by an initial, obligation free chat with an AIA Financial Wellbeing team member to explore whether financial advice is suitable for you based on your situation and goals.

They can also explain the process and answer any questions you may have. 

                                    2. Meeting your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner

Next, you can book a complimentary meeting with an AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner to discuss your needs and the path forward. Before the meeting, you’ll receive an invitation to fill in details on your financial situation.

Your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner will give you an indication of the advice fee, based on the complexity of advice you need, so you can make an informed decision whether to proceed with receiving a personalised financial plan. This meeting usually takes 60-90 minutes. 

                                    3. Building your tailored financial plan 

If you wish to proceed and agree to the advice fee, your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner will prepare a personalised plan for you, called a Statement of Advice (SoA).

This usually includes your current financial situation, objectives, and attitude towards risk. It may also include recommendations depending on your needs.

For example:

A protection strategy to make sure your life insurance is suitable for your needs

A strategy to maximise your super and grow your wealth

A plan to put you on track for the retirement lifestyle you want

Note that AIA Financial Wellbeing will conduct product research and not solely consider AIA products. They have a broad approved product list and are legally obligated to recommend you products and services that are in your best interests.

Your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner will then outline the next steps and timeframes, so you know what to expect. 

                                    4. Your Statement of Advice (SoA)

Your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner will talk you through their recommendations in the SoA. If you’re satisfied, they’ll work with you to put your financial plan in place.

Once your plan is in place, you can seek further help from your AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner as you need it, to keep up with changes in your life.

                                    Does AIA Financial Wellbeing only recommend AIA products when providing personal financial advice?

If you’re seeking personal advice, tailored to your individual circumstances, AIA Financial Wellbeing have several product providers on their Approved Product List (APL), not just AIA.

AIA Financial Wellbeing will conduct product research and not solely consider AIA products. They are legally obligated to recommend you products and services that are in your best interests.

                                    How much does personal financial advice cost?

Fees are carefully scaled, depending on the complexity of the financial advice you need. They can range from around $660 to $5,500 (including GST).

These fees will be explained to you in your first call with an AIA Financial Wellbeing team member.

                                    Who can give financial advice?

Individuals or businesses that provide financial advice are required to have an Australian financial services (AFS) licence.

All AIA Financial Wellbeing Planners are accredited and comply with professional standards. AIA Financial Wellbeing is operated by AIA Financial Services Pty Limited, a subsidiary of AIA Australia, under a separate Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL).

                                    Do I need a financial planner to manage my super?

No, however an AIA Financial Wellbeing Planner can provide advice on growing your super and strategies to achieve this.

Please note AIA Financial Wellbeing don’t provide financial advice on investments held within self-managed super funds (SMSF).

You’ll need to decide based on your needs, budget and financial circumstance if financial advice is right for you.
