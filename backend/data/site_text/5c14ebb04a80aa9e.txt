Manage your home loan repayments

Direct debit repayments

You can modify your repayment amount, frequency, date, or the account your repayments are taken from through the CommBank app or by logging on to NetBank. This includes setting up or cancelling your Direct Debit Requests (DDR) from accounts held with CBA or even from another financial institution.

To make any other requests, 
contact us
 or visit your nearest CommBank branch.

Change direct debit

Increase or decrease your repayments

By increasing your repayments, you can pay off your home loan faster and reduce the interest you’ll pay over time.

Alternatively, you can reduce your repayments to free up some cash, provided we’ve reduced the interest rate or you’ve gotten ahead on your loan by making additional repayments.

When you change your repayments online, we’ll do all the checks to make sure your new repayment amount is enough to repay the loan in remaining contracted loan term.

Change amount

Monthly, fortnightly or weekly repayments

You can choose to make your Principal and Interest home loan repayments monthly, fortnightly or weekly. Increasing the frequency of your repayments can help you pay less interest over the life of the loan. 

You might also want to consider aligning your repayment date to a few days after you get paid to avoid missing repayments. This could make it easier to stay on track with other large outgoings you may have. 

For Interest Only payments, you can only pay monthly.

Change date or frequency

Change your repayment type

Interest Only vs Principal and Interest

Principal and Interest repayments reduce your home loan balance and cover the interest owed each repayment. However, your minimum monthly repayment amount will be higher compared with Interest Only

Interest Only repayments will lower your minimum monthly repayment amount, but you'll pay more interest over the life of your loan

Frequently asked questions

How are my home loan repayments calculated?

Your home loan repayment amount is based on how much is owing on the loan, as well as any ongoing fees, the interest rate and the loan term. We regularly recalculate your loan repayment amount to make sure you’re able to repay the loan in the remaining loan term.

If the interest rate on your loan changes, your home loan repayments may change. If they do, we’ll send you a statement and letter with details of the change, provided your repayments have moved upwards (we won't necessarily notify you if they move downwards). 

Why have my home loan repayments increased?

Your repayment amount may increase because of one or more of the following:

An interest rate rise; or

We have to recalculate your repayments due to a large redraw; or

You’re rolling off a fixed or introductory period that had a lower rate than your new loan type.

Can I change my repayment amount?

Depending on your home loan type, you may be able to change your Direct Debit repayment amount. We’ll need to check that your new repayment amount allows you to repay the loan within the remaining loan term.

How do I change my Home Loan Direct Debit repayment amount?

Change your direct debit repayment amount, frequency, date and account directly in 
NetBank
 or the CommBank app

To make any other requests, 
contact us
 or visit your nearest CommBank branch.

Can I change to weekly or fortnightly repayments?
