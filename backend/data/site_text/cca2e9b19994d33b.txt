Pet Insurance costs could vary depending on the level of cover and details about your pet, such as breed and health history. It can help with unexpected expenses related to accidents, injuries and illnesses depending on your policy. Some policies may also offer optional non-insurance benefits such as routine care. You can find out how your premium is calculated in the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS).

How to better plan for your pet

Here are some tips on how you can budget for your pet.

Start by planning for initial costs like adoption fees, vaccinations, and essential supplies.

Create a plan for recurring expenses such as food, grooming, routine vet care, and set aside an emergency fund for unexpected veterinary bills.

Review optional protection measures for your pet such as vaccination boosters, vitamins and nutrients, and protection options such as pet insurance.

Regular vet visits and DIY grooming can help reduce costs, while investing in high-quality food promotes long-term health.

Arrange pet-sitting exchanges with family and friends to save on boarding costs.
