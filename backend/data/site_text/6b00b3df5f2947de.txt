Interest Only home loans

Understanding some important things about an Interest Only home loan can help you decide whether it’s the right payment option for you.

                        What's Interest Only?

What’s Interest Only?

A home loan repayment typically consists of two parts:

The principal component – the amount you borrow (your loan balance)  

The interest component – the amount the lender charges on your outstanding balance

With an Interest Only home loan, your minimum repayments will only cover the interest charges on your loan for an agreed period of time.  

This means your loan balance won’t reduce during the interest-only period, since you are not making any principal repayments.

Interest rates for Interest Only home loans tend to be higher than Principal & Interest home loans (where your payments cover both the principal and the interest).

An interest only home loan may be suitable if you’re looking for: 

A way to maximise your tax deductions as a 
property investor

A temporary way to reduce your outgoing expenses as well as manage a temporary income reduction (e.g. if you're receiving parental leave or paying educational costs while you’re studying)

An interest-only period is available for CommBank Investment home loans and Owner Occupied home loans.

Important things you should know

You’re paying more interest over the life of your home loan

Because you’re only paying the interest amount off your loan during your Interest Only period, you’re not paying the loan balance (principal component), which means you’ll pay more interest over the life of your loan.

If you pay both the Principal and Interest you’ll reduce your loan balance earlier in the loan term, which means the amount of interest payable will also reduce, because interest is calculated on the outstanding balance of your home loan.

Interest Only periods

You can switch between Principal and Interest repayment and Interest Only payment options during the life of your loan. However, there are limits for how long you can have Interest Only periods. 

The maximum Interest Only period at any one time is five years for all CBA home loans

Total Interest Only periods allowed during the life of the loan (per home loan account number) is 5 years for owner occupiers and 15 years for investors

Interest Only is not available in the last five years of your loan term

These limits apply when you request a new or extended Interest Only payment.

Your Interest Only period expires

When your Interest Only period expires, your home loan repayments will change to Principal and Interest. This means your repayments will increase as you start paying off your loan balance.

To prepare for this change and remain in control of your repayments, make sure you know your expiry date and plan accordingly. You can also

To find the expiry date for your CommBank home loan, log on to NetBank > View account > Account Information. Make sure you select your Interest Only home loan from the drop-down list.

How Interest Only affects repayments

Download image

With an Interest Only loan you choose to make payments that only cover the interest amount (for a set period). Interest Only payments are lower than if you were paying both the Principal and Interest components, however your loan balance isn’t reducing. 

At the end of an Interest Only period, the balance of the loan must be paid back to the bank over the period remaining before the end of the loan. This means that the Principal and Interest repayments will be higher than they would have been prior to the Interest Only period.

In this example, Jo has taken out a home loan of $500,000 for 30 years.
1

If she were to make Principal and Interest repayments at 3.99% p.a. from year 1, her monthly repayments would be $2,385

If she decides to make Interest Only payments:

For the first 5 years of her loan at 4.61% p.a., her monthly payments would be approximately $1,921

In year 6 her payments would revert to Principal and Interest at 3.99% p.a. Her monthly repayments would then increase to $2,637

Work out what your repayments might be using the 
repayment calculator.
