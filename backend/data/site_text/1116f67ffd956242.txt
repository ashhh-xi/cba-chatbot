** This offer is valid from 6 May 2025. To secure the offer you will need to engage the services of a Home-in partner law firm via the Home-in app on or after this date. If you engaged the services of a Home-in partner law firm via the Home-in app before this date, you are not eligible for this offer. This offer cannot be combined with other Home-in offers.

This offer is only available to CommBank customers who meet the following criteria:

(a) have an eligible CommBank transaction account: Smart Access, Complete Access, Everyday Offset, Pensioner Security (excluding Pensioner Security Passbook accounts) or Private Bank Account; and 

(b) fund an eligible residential property purchase with a CommBank home loan; and

Additional fees apply to conveyancing services in respect of complex titles (such as old system, leasehold and company titles), which are excluded from this offer.

This offer is only available through CommBank’s proprietary channels, it is not available to customers that originate through Bankwest, Unloan or a broker channel. 

If you settle on a property without meeting the eligibility criteria, this offer will not apply and you will be required to pay the standard list price for your conveyancing services.

 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 10 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components. 

Information provided (including interest rates) are subject to change.

Calculations are estimates provided as a guide only. They assume interest rates don’t change over the life of the loan and are calculated on the rate that applies for the initial period of the loan. Interest rates referenced are current rates and may change at any time.

Fees and charges are payable. The calculations do not take into account fees, charges or other amounts that may be charged to your loan (such as establishment or monthly service fees or stamp duty). Lenders' Mortgage Insurance or a Low Deposit Premium may apply to your loan depending on the size of your deposit; security, applicant and loan attributes. This is a one-off cost and will be added to the loan amount. Any of these additional amounts will increase repayments under the loan.

We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making interest only payments or principal and interest repayments.  During an interest only period, your interest only payments won't reduce your loan balance. At the end of an interest only period, your repayments will increase to cover principal and interest components.

* Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25 year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5-year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed period. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.

Calculations are not a loan approval. Applications are subject to credit approval, satisfactory security and minimum deposit requirements. Conditions apply to all loan options. Full terms and conditions will be set out in our loan offer, if an offer is made. Fees and charges are payable. Interest rates are subject to change. As this advice has been prepared without considering your objectives, financial situation or needs, you should consider its appropriateness to your circumstances before acting on the advice. You should also read our 
Financial Services Guide
.

^^
 Redraw is dependent on having the required amount available in special repayments (additional repayments). You can redraw available funds for free when done via CommBank app or NetBank, however a redraw fee may be applicable if you ask us via phone or in branch to support you with accessing your additional repayments (waived until 30 June 2025).
