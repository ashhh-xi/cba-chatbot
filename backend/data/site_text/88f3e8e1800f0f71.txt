How to make the most of your credit card's interest-free period

Taking advantage of your card’s interest-free period can help you smooth your cash flow.

Most credit cards offer an interest-free period on purchases up to a certain number of days. This period is the maximum amount of time between you making a purchase and then being charged interest – as long as you don’t already owe money on your credit card.

Being able to buy now and then pay later is one of the biggest advantages of a credit card. So how can you make the most of the interest-free period?

What's interest?

Interest
 is the cost associated with borrowing money through your credit card account, and is expressed as an annual percentage rate. You can find out your 
interest rates and charges
 on your CommBank 
monthly statement
. The 
purchase interest rate
 is the one most commonly advertised by lenders, and refers to the rate charged on purchases made with a credit card if an 
interest-free period
 doesn’t apply.

What's an interest-free period and how is it calculated?

An interest-free period is a period of time when no 
interest is charged
 on a new purchase, and may automatically apply when you open a new credit card account. It will continue to apply as long as you pay your 
closing balance
 in full by the due date each and every month.

Most credit cards offer an interest-free period of up to a certain amount of days. This number is the maximum number of days you won’t be charged interest, and depends on when you make your purchase within the statement cycle.

How it works

Most 
CommBank credit cards
 offer an interest-free period on purchases of up to 44 or up to 55 days. Excludes our 
Business Low Rate credit card
 which doesn’t have an interest free period. 

Each statement period runs for about 30 days. Then, it’s 14 days for Awards credit cards and 25 days for non-Awards credit cards from when your statement period finishes to the payment due date. If you’re eligible for an interest-free period, the minimum number of interest-free days you’ll have is 14 or 25 days depending on your credit card product.

In the above example, John’s interest-free
*
 period on purchases is up to 44 days.

1. 4 days after John’s statement period begun on May 1, John purchases some shoes for $100. He has 40 days interest-free on this purchase.

2. On May 14, John purchases a TV for $1,000. He has 30 days interest-free on this purchase.

3. On May 30, John’s statement period ends and he receives his statement. John now has 14 days to pay off his closing balance in full which is made up of his purchases during the period. In this case, his closing balance is $1,100.

4. June 13 is John’s payment due date. To avoid paying any interest on the purchases he’s made, John must pay his closing balance in full by the payment due date. If he doesn’t pay in full, he’ll lose his interest-free period on purchases and interest will be charged on his unpaid balance (including any purchases made since his last statement period ended) from after the payment due date.

John will receive a late payment fee if he doesn’t pay at least the minimum payment shown on his statement by the due date each month.

What happens if you don’t repay your closing balance in full?

If you do not pay your closing balance in full or just make a 
minimum repayment
, you will lose your interest-free period and interest will be charged on your unpaid balance from after the due date until you repay in full.

How to avoid paying interest

If you have been paying interest on purchases, you can regain your interest-free
*
 period by:

Paying your 
account balance
 in full to get interest-free on all purchases from that day.
1
 Your account balance is made up of everything you owe up until today, including any purchases you’ve made since your last statement.
2

Paying your 
closing balance
 in full by the due date shown on your statement to get interest-free on new purchases in your next statement period. Your closing balance is the amount you owe from your last statement period. 

Remember, the sooner you pay off everything you owe, the less interest you’ll need to pay – you don’t need to wait until the due date.

How to take advantage of the interest-free
*
 period

Pay your closing balance off in full each month

Set reminders to make sure you pay your balance in time or use 
AutoPay

Try to plan your spending so you make any bigger purchases at the start of the statement period to give yourself more time to repay.

Things you should know

* The examples above are for illustrative purposes only. The examples assume that you have previously paid your closing balance in full by the due date each month and are eligible for an interest-free period on purchases, and you can continue to do so to maintain your interest-free period. The examples also assumes only purchases have been made and no balance transfers, SurePay instalment plans or cash advance transactions apply.

 Please note: sometimes we don’t receive payments in time to process them the same day as you make them, for instance when you transfer from another bank, which may affect this.

2
 Your account balance does not include any pending transactions.
