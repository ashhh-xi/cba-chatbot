How does it work

Credit cards in Australia work similar to credit cards elsewhere. Broadly, there are four types of credit cards: 
interest-free
, 
low fee
, 
low rate
 and 
awards
.

They are a form of consumer credit or finance and as such, regulated by Australian financial governing bodies and follow Australian banking industry codes.

Benefits        

In addition to access to credit which can help manage unplanned expenses, a credit card can be an effective tool for making purchases, simplifying your finances and even smoothing out your cash flow. You may also use a credit card to start building or improve on your credit history.

Also, making sure you pay your bills – such as phone and electricity – on time is another way to building a positive credit report (but keep in mind having a lot of credit applications against your name can work against your credit score).

You may also qualify for a loyalty or rewards program. For example, some credit cards offer points when you spend with selected merchants, benefits or a variety of discounted offers.

Trade-offs

Credit cards may have a number of associated fees associated, including annual fees (although CommBank does not have these), monthly fees, cash advance fees, late payment fees and international transaction fees. These depend mostly on the type of card that you may hold, the outstanding balance and the repayment period.

Upon using the card at a merchant, you may also pay them a surcharge.

Who can apply

We support more people moving to Australia than any other bank, but just like most banks have eligibility requirements in place.

Compare cards

It’s worth taking the time to consider what it is you really want from your credit card before you apply.

Also, consider that these days, many debit cards can be used for a lot of the same things that credit cards are used for, such as online shopping.

The primary difference between debit and credit cards is that when you use a debit card, you’re spending what you already have in a transaction account (for example, your savings account).

Interested? Find the credit card that's right for you

Our credit card comparison page might help to give an idea of which card might suit you.

Once you’ve chosen the credit card you think will best suit you, read up on the fees and charges, as well as the terms and conditions.
