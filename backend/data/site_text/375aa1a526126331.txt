Fixed Rate

Things you should know

Please refer to our 
Home Loan Fact Sheets
 for details regarding our loans. The reference rate for your loan will depend on the repayment type you select – Principal and Interest or Interest Only. Interest Only period switches and extensions can be requested in both years and/or months via selected processes. The reference rate applicable for an Interest Only period applied in years and/or months will be the same as the Interest Only reference rate applicable to your loan type. Talk to your lender for more information. 
See rates for products no longer offered (PDF)

1
 To apply for a Wealth Package, you must have an eligible home loan or line of credit with an initial package lending balance of at least $150,000 at the time of your application. Package lending balance is the sum of the account balance of eligible home lending accounts and the credit limit of Viridian Line of Credit accounts that you have with us at the time you apply for Wealth Package. Eligible home loans include: Standard Variable Rate home loan, Fixed Rate home loans and Viridian Line of Credit. A non-refundable annual fee of $395 is payable in advance. The package can be established in the name of one or two individual’s name/s, or in the name of a corporate entity. It cannot be established in the name of a business or family investment trust. Please refer to the 
Wealth Package Fact Sheet
 and 
Package Terms and Conditions
 for full details

2
 Rate/s apply to new lending only and may include a margin below or above the applicable reference rate. The current reference rates can be found here.

3 
At the end of the fixed rate period, the interest rate converts to the applicable Standard Variable Rate relevant to your loan purpose and repayment type at that time, less any applicable package discount specified in your Loan Contract.

4 
Minimum $1,000 withdrawal with a $0 Redraw fee over the counter at any Commonwealth Bank branch and no minimum electronically with a $0 Redraw fee. Redraw is dependent on having the required amount available in special repayments (extra repayments).

5 
You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 15 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

8 
You can link one Everyday Offset account to each eligible Digi Home Loan and up to two Everyday Offset accounts to each eligible Simple Home Loan. An offset feature fee will apply, see ‘Fees we charge for consumer mortgage lending products'.

~
 We charge the Rate Lock Fee when we process your request. It is therefore important that you have sufficient funds in your nominated account. The Rate Lock feature only applies to new Fixed Rate home loan and Fixed Rate Investment home loan applications. Rate Lock does not apply to Home Seekers, switching, splitting, top-ups, loan purpose transfers or repayment changes.   

#
 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 10 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

Information provided (including interest rates) are subject to change.

Calculations are estimates provided as a guide only. They assume interest rates don’t change over the life of the loan and are calculated on the rate that applies for the initial period of the loan. Interest rates referenced are current rates and may change at any time.

Fees and charges are payable. The calculations do not take into account fees, charges or other amounts that may be charged to your loan (such as establishment or monthly service fees or stamp duty). Lenders' Mortgage Insurance or a Low Deposit Premium may apply to your loan depending on the size of your deposit; security, applicant and loan attributes. This is a one-off cost and will be added to the loan amount. Any of these additional amounts will increase repayments under the loan.

We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making interest only payments or principal and interest repayments. During an interest only period, your interest only payments won't reduce your loan balance. At the end of an interest only period, your repayments will increase to cover principal and interest components.

Rates are subject to change. Applications are subject to normal credit approval. Full terms and conditions will be included in our loan offer. Fees and charges are payable.

* Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25-year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5-year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed period. During an Interest Only period, your interest only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.
