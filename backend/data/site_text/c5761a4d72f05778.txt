Frequently asked questions

                                    What is a conveyancer?

A conveyancer is a licensed professional who specializes in property law and handles the legal aspects of buying or selling real estate. Their main role is to ensure that the property transfer process is smooth and legally compliant. 

Using a conveyancer can help you navigate the complexities of property transactions and provide peace of mind throughout the home buying or selling process. 

Home-in provides market-leading conveyancing services across Australia and is built to ensure you have a simpler, secure and less stressful home buying experience/journey

Home-in
 provides conveyancing services across Australia and is a brand of CBA New Digital Businesses Pty Ltd, which is a wholly owned but non-guaranteed subsidiary of CommBank.

                                    What does a conveyancer do?

Here are the main tasks conveyancers perform:

Contract Review
: They examine the contract of sale to ensure all terms are fair and legally sound

Legal Advice
: They provide guidance on the legal implications of the property transaction

Title Searches
: They conduct searches to verify the property's title and check for any encumbrances or restrictions

Document Preparation
: They prepare and lodge all necessary legal documents, including the transfer of ownership

Settlement Coordination
: They manage the settlement process, ensuring all financial and legal obligations are met.

                                    How much does a conveyancer cost?

The cost of a conveyancer in Australia can vary depending on several factors, including the complexity of the transaction and the location of the property. It's important to get a detailed quote from your conveyancer upfront to understand what is included in their fees and to avoid any unexpected costs. 

                                    Should you use a conveyancer or a solicitor when you’re buying a home?

When buying a house, you can choose to use either a conveyancer or a solicitor, depending on your needs and the complexity of the transaction:

Conveyancer: 
A conveyancer specializes in property law and handles the legal aspects of property transactions. They are typically more affordable and are well-suited for straightforward transactions. If your property purchase is simple and doesn't involve complex legal issues, a conveyancer could efficiently manage the process.

Solicitor: 
A solicitor has broader legal expertise and can provide additional legal services beyond conveyancing. They are ideal for more complex transactions that may involve legal issues such as tax implications, disputes, or other legal matters. While solicitors are generally more expensive than conveyancers, they offer comprehensive legal support.
