FAQs

                                    Who is eligible for a SurePay instalment plan?

SurePay instalment plans are not available on CommBank Neo cards, non-Awards Business cards, Corporate cards, or for balance transfers. On eligible cards, if you are currently over your credit limit or in arrears, you will not be able to set up a SurePay instalment plan until you bring your credit card balance below your credit limit and, or pay your overdue amount. For SurePay Purchase Plans, you need to have made a purchase (not pending) over $100 in the last 14 days. The plan amount and setup fee cannot exceed your Card balance or limit.

                                    Is there a fee for setting up a SurePay plan?

An upfront set-up fee will apply for Purchase plans. You’ll pay the fee in full as part of your first monthly instalment. The set-up fee will be displayed on your next statement and is non-refundable. There is no set-up fee if you’re setting up a Balance or Cash Advance plan.

                                    How do I set up a SurePay instalment plan?

In the CommBank app go to Accounts > Credit card account > Manage account > SurePay plans

In NetBank go to Settings > Set up/manage SurePay plan

Alternatively, call us on 13 221, or visit your nearest branch

                                    How many active SurePay instalment plans can I have?

You can have up to 50 active plans at a time, on each eligible credit card.

                                    How many purchases can I add to a SurePay instalment plan?

You can set up a SurePay purchase plan for a single purchase made within the last 14 days. The purchase must be at least $100 for a 3-months plan, $150 for a 6-month plan and $300 for a 12-month plan. At any given time, you can have up to 50 SurePay instalment plans on your Commbank credit card.

                                    How long will it take for my plan to set up?

It may take up to 3 business days. You will see a ‘Pending’ status in the list view of your SurePay plans within the CommBank app or NetBank. Once set up, we will send you a confirmation email containing information about your plan.

                                    When are my instalments due?

You’ll be asked to make your SurePay monthly instalment payment/s on your regular statement due date each month.

Your first instalment will be due on the due date of the next statement you receive after setting up the plan.

All the details of your plan including your monthly instalment amount and total plan instalments amounts will be included on your 
monthly statement
.
 This includes your payment options and a summary of your plan progress. You can also track your progress any time in NetBank or the CommBank app.

                                    How do I meet my monthly instalment payment?

Once you have set up a SurePay instalment plan, your monthly instalment amount will be added to your credit card minimum payment amount and displayed on your 
monthly statement
 as the ‘Instalment payment’ amount.

Continue to pay the instalment amount each month to ensure your SurePay plan/s are paid off as planned and at least the minimum amount on your main balance.

                                    What if I miss a payment?

If you miss a monthly instalment payment, the unpaid instalment amount for that month will be returned to your main balance and you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed from when you first set up your SurePay plan.

If you miss three consecutive payments we’ll automatically cancel your SurePay plan. You won’t be charged a fee if your plan is cancelled – however any outstanding balance will be transferred back to your purchase (or cash advance) rate and added to the total owing on your latest statement on the cancellation date. From the transfer date, you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate. Please refer to your most recent statement to confirm your card's current interest rate as this may have changed since you first set up your SurePay plan.

                                    What if I want to cancel a SurePay instalment plan?

You can cancel your SurePay plan at any time in NetBank or the CommBank App. Please allow up to four business days for us to process the cancellation.

There are no fees for cancelling however any outstanding balance will be transferred back to your purchase (or cash advance) balance and added to the total owing on your latest statement on the cancellation date.

From the transfer date, you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed since you first set up your SurePay plan. Please refer to your most recent statement to confirm your card's current interest rate.

                                    How will my credit card monthly SurePay instalment payments be applied?

If you have a SurePay instalment plan, your payments to your credit card will be applied as follows:

Current monthly instalments, starting with interest and instalment setup fee, if applicable

Your non-instalment-plan balances

Your remaining instalment balances

This means that your current monthly instalment payments are always paid first, even if you have other balances with higher interest rates (such as cash advances or purchases not in a plan).

If you have multiple plans, payments will be applied to the plans in order of highest to lowest interest rate, or if all plan interest rates are the same, from oldest to newest. If this arrangement no longer suits you, you may cancel your plan at any time.

                                    How does interest work on SurePay?

The interest rate will be fixed for the full term of the plan.

Any interest-free period on purchases will no longer apply to the purchase or balance you transfer to the SurePay Plan.

You may be eligible for interest free periods on purchases not in a plan if each month, you pay off all non-instalment balances plus your monthly instalment payment/s by the due date each month.

Learn more about interest free periods.

                                    Will my statement look different after I setup a new SurePay instalment Plan?

Yes, your statement will include your SurePay payment options, an explanation of your payment options, and your instalment plans.

Things you should know

You won't be able to apply for an instalment plan if you don't meet our criteria (e.g. if you have exceeded your limit or you are in default). Instalment plans are not available on CommBank Neo, non-Awards Business Cards, corporate cards or balance transfers.  The terms of the 
CommBank Credit 
Card Conditions of Use
 relating to instalment plans (section 5) will apply.

While you have an instalment plan, payments to your credit card will be applied in the following order:

Current monthly instalments, starting with interest and instalment setup fee, if applicable

Your non-instalment-plan balances

Your remaining instalment balances

This means that your current monthly instalment payments are always paid first, even if you have other balances with higher interest rates (such as cash advances or purchases not in a plan). If you have multiple plans, payments will be applied to the plans in order of highest to lowest interest rate, or if all plan interest rates are the same, from oldest to newest.

Any interest-free period on purchases will no longer apply once the purchase is put on a plan.

You can cancel your instalment plan at any time. When a cancellation is processed, the outstanding instalment balance will be transferred to your purchases balance (or cash advance balance for cancelled cash advance plans) and accrue interest from the transfer date at your account’s standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed from when you first set up your SurePay plan.

If you miss a monthly instalment payment, the unpaid instalment amount for that month will be returned to your main balance and you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed from when you first set up your SurePay plan. If you cancel a plan this will also apply to any outstanding balance.

If you miss three consecutive payments we’ll automatically cancel your SurePay plan. You won’t be charged a fee if your plan is cancelled – however any outstanding balance will be transferred back to your purchase (or cash advance) rate and added to the total owing on your latest statement on the cancellation date. From the transfer date, you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate. Please refer to your most recent statement to confirm your card's current interest rate as this may have changed since you first set up your SurePay plan.

*SurePay Purchase Plan terms and conditions

1. To pay off a one-off purchase of $100 or more, made in the last 14 days with a 0% p.a. interest rate for a fee of 2% for 3 month plans, 3% for 6 month plans and 5% for 12 month plans.

2. Minimum transaction amount per term: $100 for 3 months, $150 for 6 months and $300 for 12 months.
