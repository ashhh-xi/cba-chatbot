What are shares and are they a good investment option?

When you buy a share, you own part of a company. Your investment grows as the company’s value increases or when it pays dividends (a portion of profits distributed to shareholders). Reinvesting dividends and holding shares longer term can allow your money to grow through compounding.

Over the past 25 years, shares have delivered better than average returns compared with other investments.

They also offer flexibility, as you can usually access your money within two business days of selling.

It’s important to note that shares come with risks such as capital loss risk (Investment value can decrease), liquidity risk (buying or selling can be difficult due to market conditions) and market and economic risks (share price can be impacted by several factors). To manage risk, consider an investment option which suits your needs and circumstance. Of course, when considering investing for the first time you should always seek your own financial advice.

You can apply for a CommSec Share Trading Account if you are:

18 years or older with an Australian residential and postal address; or

An Australian registered or incorporated company; or

An Australian trust or SMSF.

                                    What is a settlement account, and why do I need one for my trading account?

A settlement account is a linked bank account used to manage the money going in and out of your trading account. When you buy or sell shares, a process called T+2 settlement takes place where ownership of the shares are exchanged for money between the buyer and seller. This occurs on the second business day after the trade takes place.  By opening a CommSec Australian Shares account via the CommBank app, you'll also open a 
Commonwealth Direct Investment Account (CDIA)
, providing you with our best brokerage rates and real-time fund transfers.

                                    How do I transfer my shares to CommSec?

Important: The shares you wish to transfer (whether held with another broker or the share registry) must have identical registration details (both name and address) to your CommSec trading account. If registration details differ by even one character, you will need to change these details before completing the form.

You can transfer shares held with another broker (i.e., Stake, nabtrade), with the share registry (i.e., Computershare, MUFG Corporate Markets), or in another CommSec account, by logging into 
CommSec
.

To transfer shares into CommSec, log into CommSec, head to 
Settings
, navigate to 
Service Request
, then select 
Transfer Shares
. Once you begin the transfer, you’ll be asked a series of questions about your shares.

For the transfer to be successful the name and address registered on your holdings must match your CommSec account.

This process normally takes 2-3 business days to complete.

                                    Can I use the CommBank app or CommSec app to manage my account?

You can use both the CommBank app and the CommSec app to trade and manage your CommSec Australian Shares account. To view your shares in the CommBank app simply log in, tap the ‘Investing hub’ tile from your app dashboard or Library.

                                    What to look for in Australian shares?

When considering investing in shares there are a few questions to ask:

Can the price grow? Look at the company’s financial health, earnings, and how it’s managed.

Does it pay dividends? Some companies share profits with investors through dividends.

How does the market affect it? Industry trends and economic conditions can impact performance.

It’s also important to evaluate the company’s earnings, cashflow, governance and market or industry.

Analysts use key measures like the  price to earnings ratio, price to book ratio, earnings per share and dividend yield, as well as overall share price performance of a particular share to understand its overall value.  Of course, if investing for the first time you should seek out your own professional financial advice first to understand your risk profile. Also note that past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance when doing your stock selection.

Check out the Market highlights,the CommSec Invest podcast, and explore the ‘Learn’ tab via the 
Investing hub
 in the CommBank app.

What is compounding? 

Compounding is when your investments earn returns, and then those returns start earning returns too. Over time, this can help your money grow faster. 

For illustrative purposes only: if you invested $1000 and earnt a 5% return, you’ll have $1050 after a year. If you leave that money invested, the next year if you earn another 5% on your original $1,000 and on the $50 you earned – so your total grows to $1,102.50. The longer you stay invested, the bigger the effect of compounding. Reinvesting dividends can also help your money grow over time.

How to calculate the potential return on investment?

Return on Investment (ROI) is the gain/loss you have made on your initial investment.

ROI =

Example:

Purchase price = $5.00

Sale price = $6.00

No of shares purchased = 100

Brokerage fees = $10 ($5 to buy and $5 to sell)

(Sale Price – Purchase Price) x Number of Shares Purchased – Brokerage fees = ($6.00 - $5.00) x 100 - $10 = $90

This is your profit.

Purchase Price x Number of Shares Purchased + Brokerage fees = $5.00 x 100 + $10 = $510

This is your initial investment.

Return on Investment (ROI) = $90 ÷ $510 x 100 = 17.64%
