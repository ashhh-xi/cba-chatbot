 The fee comparison is for MySuper products. This fee comparison is based on the Lifestage 1965-69 investment option for a member balance of $50,000 and may vary for different age cohorts. The Chant West Super Fund Fee Survey compares the Lifestage option that is closest to 71% growth assets, which is consistent with the average risk and return profile of most non-lifecycle products. Total fees and costs include administration fees and costs, investment fees and costs and net transaction costs on a gross of tax basis. Fund averages are calculated by Chant West on a weighted average basis. This comparison has been prepared by CFS using data sourced from the Chant West Super Fund Fee Survey, effective 31 March 2025 and is based on information provided to Chant West by third parties, that is believed accurate at the time of publication.
