Understanding credit cards (FAQs)

                                    What is a credit card?

A credit card allows you to borrow money from a bank, giving you access to a predetermined amount of funds, known as your credit limit. This limit is established when you apply for the card, and it represents the maximum amount you can borrow at any given time.

                                    How do credit cards work?

When using a credit card, you are effectively borrowing money from a lender. You’ll have to pay back that money in the future, possibly along with interest, too.

More information about credit cards and the different types of cards can be found here – 
How do credit cards work
?

                                    How does credit card interest work?

Credit card interest
 is a charge for borrowing money from a financial institution with your credit card. 

 How much interest you’ll pay depends on the type of card you have, the transactions you make, and when you make repayments. 

 More information can be found 
here
