Frequently asked questions

                                    What are home loan interest rates?

Home interest rates are the percentage of the loan amount that lenders charge borrowers for using their money to purchase a home. These rates can be either fixed or variable:

Fixed Interest Rates: 
These rates remain the same for a set period, usually 1 to 5 years. They provide stability and predictability in your repayments.

Variable Interest Rates:
 These rates can change over time, influenced by the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) cash rate and other economic factors. Variable rates can offer more flexibility but come with the risk of rate increases.

                                    What is a home loan comparison rate?

A home loan comparison rate helps show the true cost of the loan by combining the interest rate with certain fees and charges. It's expressed as a single percentage to make it easier to compare different loans. This way, you can see the overall cost, not just the advertised interest rate.

Things you should know

Please refer to our 
Home Loan Fact Sheets

The reference rate applicable for an Interest Only period applied in years and/or months will be the same as the Interest Only reference rate applicable to your loan type. Talk to your lender for more information.

 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 10 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

Information provided (including interest rates) are subject to change.

Calculations are estimates provided as a guide only. They assume interest rates don’t change over the life of the loan and are calculated on the rate that applies for the initial period of the loan. Interest rates referenced are current rates and may change at any time.

Fees and charges are payable. The calculations do not take into account fees, charges or other amounts that may be charged to your loan (such as establishment or monthly service fees or stamp duty). Lenders' Mortgage Insurance or a Low Deposit Premium may apply to your loan depending on the size of your deposit; security, applicant and loan attributes. This is a one-off cost and will be added to the loan amount. Any of these additional amounts will increase repayments under the loan.

We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making interest only payments or principal and interest repayments. During an interest only period, your interest only payments won't reduce your loan balance. At the end of an interest only period, your repayments will increase to cover principal and interest components.

Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5-year Interest Only period.

During an Interest Only period, your interest only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.
