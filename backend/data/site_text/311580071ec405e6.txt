How does CommBank Neo's monthly fee work?

Your CommBank Neo monthly fee is based on your credit limit .

$15 per month for $1,000 limit

$20 per month for a $2,000 limit

$25 per month for a $3,000 limit

This fee is charged at the end of your statement period. Each statement period runs for about 30 days, so you’ll be charged around the same time every month. You’ll then have 25 days from that time to pay (i.e. your due date).

The fee you pay depends on the limit you have when your statement period ends. If you change from a $3,000 to a $1,000 limit within a given statement period, and use your card, you’ll be charged a $15 fee at the end of period.

We’ll waive your monthly fee if you don’t have any processed transactions

 in a given statement period and you pay your previous statement closing balance in full (i.e. the total amount you owe from your last statement period) by the due date.

Things you should know

1 
The CommBank Yello Cashback Offers program (‘CommBank Yello Cashback Offers’) rewards you with cashback after you activate (where required) an offer presented to you via the CommBank app and you make a purchase in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of that offer. Cashback is typically received within 14 business days of a qualifying purchase, but in some cases may take longer. If you are not already enrolled, you can enrol if you are at least 18 years old, hold an eligible CommBank credit Mastercard or debit Mastercard, Business credit Mastercard or StepPay digital card, and meet the ‘Base eligibility criteria’ in the ‘CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions’ (latest version available on our website at commbank.com.au) (‘CommBank Yello’).

2 
If you don't have any processed transactions in a given statement period and pay your previous statement closing balance in full by the due date, you won't be charged a monthly fee for that statement period. We may process transactions later than the day you originally made them. This is when your transaction is no longer a pending transaction and has been fully processed by us.

3 
We’re unable to block cash advance transactions that aren’t sent to us for authorisation. These will not incur any additional fees or interest charges.
