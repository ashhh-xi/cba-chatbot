Frequently asked questions

                                    Why am I receiving an error message about my location services?

Your device location services need to be enabled to use QR Cardless. If you are an iOS user, you will need to enable ‘precise location’. 

We use this information to identify, manage and minimise security risks and detect and prevent fraud, scams and other unauthorised activity. 

                                    What if I want to deposit cash into a CommBank account but I'm not a customer? 

To deposit into a CommBank account using QR Cardless, you will need to download the CommBank app and register ahead of time.

You will need about 10 minutes and at least one physical form of ID.

Download the CommBank app from the App Store or Google Play.

Follow the prompts on-screen to get started.

Scan your ID and take a photo to help us identify you.

Follow the prompts to fill in the details.

You are now ready to deposit with QR Cardless.

                                    How can I support employees of my business with this change in process?

They will need to download the CommBank app and register ahead of time before a deposit can be made. Ensure your employees are aware that they will need to provide at least one physical form of ID (i.e. drivers licence or passport).

                                    Can I share a QR Cardless withdrawal for someone else to collect on my behalf?

You won’t be able to share a QR Cardless withdrawal or have someone else collect the money for you. In this way, QR Cardless helps protect you from unauthorised transactions.

We have alternative options available. You can:

Transfer the money to someone else's trusted eligible CommBank account. Once that person receives the funds, they can use QR Cardless to withdraw the money at a compatible CommBank ATM.

If the person doesn't bank with us, you can still transfer the money to their account and have them withdraw the funds from an ATM. PaylD transfers and most transfers made to a BSB and account number are usually processed within a few minutes, however first-time and some other transfers may be held for 24 hours as a security measure.

Never share your CommBank app registered device with anyone, including when someone makes a transaction on your behalf. If you do so, you may be liable for unauthorised transactions.

                                    How does the CommBank app store my personal details? 

We take our responsibility to protect your privacy very seriously. We apply strict security and privacy controls to the way we handle your personal information. 

More information about the digital information we collect is available in the 
Privacy Collection Notice for NetBank and the CommBank app
. It’s important to note that, we do not link this information to you unless we need to access these details for fraud or security reasons. Find out more about the

                                    How do I know if my account is eligible for QR Cardless?

Most everyday transaction accounts are eligible for QR Cardless. If you are withdrawing from or depositing to your own CommBank account, eligible accounts will be available for selection in the CommBank app.

Accounts such as Viridian Line of Credit and Term Deposits are not eligible for QR Cardless. 

If you are depositing into another individual’s CommBank account, the deposit cannot be completed at the ATM if the recipient’s account is not eligible to receive QR Cardless deposits.

Things you should know
