The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 15 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

^ This offer is valid from 6 May 2025. To secure the offer you will need to engage the services of a Home-in partner law firm via the Home-in app on or after this date. If you engaged the services of a Home-in partner law firm via the Home-in app before this date, you are not eligible for this offer. This offer cannot be combined with other Home-in offers.

This offer is only available to CommBank customers who meet the following criteria:

(a) have an eligible CommBank transaction account: Smart Access, Complete Access, Everyday Offset, Pensioner Security (excluding Pensioner Security Passbook accounts) or Private Bank Account; and 

(b) fund an eligible residential property purchase with a CommBank home loan; and

(c) settle this property purchase using the in-app legal services provided through Home-in.

This offer only applies to buy-side conveyancing services for residential property purchases in Australia. Home-in does not offer conveyancing services for the purchase of off-the-plan, rural/agricultural, retail or commercial properties, or properties with a purchase price in excess of $5,000,000. Additional fees apply to conveyancing services in respect of complex titles (such as old system, leasehold and company titles), which are excluded from this offer.

This offer is only available through CommBank’s proprietary channels, it is not available to customers that originate through Bankwest, Unloan or a broker channel. 

If you settle on a property without meeting the eligibility criteria, this offer will not apply and you will be required to pay the standard list price for your conveyancing services. If you do not ultimately settle on a property purchase with Home-in within 6 months of your first contract review, any disbursements, contract review fees and ancillary service fees incurred will become payable to Home-in at the standard list price.

The $699 (including GST) offer includes the following conveyancing services: one standard contract review, reasonable negotiation with the vendor’s solicitor, preparation of documents and figures required for settlement and electronic or paper settlement for your property.

Disbursements are additional and charged at cost. For some property purchases, you may require or request additional services for which we charge a professional fee, such as expedited settlement or usage of a trust account.

Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25 year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5 year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed or guaranteed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed or guaranteed period. During an interest only period, your interest only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.
