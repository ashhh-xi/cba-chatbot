Where do I start?

It can be tough knowing where to start your investment journey – from how much you need to start investing, to what you need to think about. The good news is you’ve taken the first step by starting to research.

Keep reading for some investment options and resources to help you along the way.

What is the difference between saving and investing?

Saving is a way to store money for when you need it in the near term, whereas investing is about acquiring growth assets or assets that generate income, with the aim of building your wealth over the long term. The key differences between both are defined by risk tolerance, investment timeline and personal financial goal(s). So, what does that mean?

Saving is a process of putting aside money for use in the near future which pays you an amount of interest over that period.

May be suitable for short-term financial goals.

Lower-risk financial products (but not necessarily risk-free).

Low rate of return

Risk that inflation may impact value of returns.

Investing is a process of creating wealth in the future with long-term goals.

May be suitable for long-term wealth goals

Higher-risk financial product

May offer higher rates of return

No guaranteed returns.

What should I consider when investing?

Some important considerations include your personal goals, investment timeline and risk appetite.

These should align with your choice of investment, the fund’s investment objectives, and risk profile.

Additional considerations include:

Fees and costs that may apply

Tax implications in relation to your individual circumstances.

It’s always important to learn as much about what you are investing in so that you can understand what are potential factors that can affect the performance of that investment.

As always, remember that investing carries risk. Past performance is not an indicator of future performance, and you should consider all reasonable factors when making an investment decision.

Common investing myths

You need lots of money to invest
 – This is simply false, with a variety of investment options available, you can start investing with small amounts and gradually build up your investment portfolio over time.

You need to wait for the right time to invest
 – If you have done the research in the investment of your choice and see its future potential you shouldn’t be limited to waiting for the right price before you start investing. Time in the market beats timing the market.

Investing is no different to gambling
 – Gambling is pure luck, and no amount of analysis and information will change your odds of taking home a winning. In Australia, and many developed markets around the world, investing operates in a highly regulated environment, which ensures investors are protected through the provision of information and legal recourse action, in instances of fraud and predatory behaviour.
