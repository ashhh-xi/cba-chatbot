The Bank will not charge Access Fees on withdrawals or account balance enquiries on deposit and transaction accounts (including MISA - On and from 16 March 2019, MISA is no longer available for sale, or able to be activated, for any loan. If a MISA has a nil balance on or after 16 March 2019, it cannot be reactivated.), home loans, investment home loans, lines of credit and personal loans through non-Commonwealth Bank ATMs in Australia. However, ATM owners may charge a fee, which will be disclosed at the time of the transaction. If you proceed with the transaction, the ATM owner’s fee will be debited to your account (in addition to the withdrawal amount, if applicable). You should check the ATM owner’s fees that apply carefully before completing transactions at non-Commonwealth Bank ATMs in Australia.
