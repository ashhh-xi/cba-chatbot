Always secure

Keeping your banking even safer

Your banking details are secured by a client number and password unique to you. If you have the 
CommBank app
, you’ll also get a 
notification to confirm the logon attempt in the app before you can access your NetBank
. This helps prevent unauthorised access to your digital banking, even if someone has your password.

We take our responsibility to protect your privacy and security when banking online seriously, and have a range of security capabilities to keep your info safe.

Here’s more on that
