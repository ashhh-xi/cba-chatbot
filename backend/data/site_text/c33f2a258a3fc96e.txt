What are cookies?

Cookies are text files that are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you access a website. As you browse, cookies gather and store some information about the way you use that website.

Cookies allow the website to recognise your device each time you visit, providing you with a better experience because the site learns your preferences as you browse. Some types of cookies also perform essential functions to enhance how the site works.

Different types of cookies

Session cookies

Session cookies allow websites to track your movements from page to page and are used for a number of reasons, such as remembering items in a shopping cart. These cookies are usually erased when you close your web browser.

Persistent cookies

Persistent cookies are stored on your computer or mobile device between browser sessions for a pre-defined amount of time. These allow the site to remember user information or settings across the site, or in some cases across different websites. They also enable targeted advertising.

First and third party cookies

First party cookies are set by the website you’re browsing. Third party cookies come from other websites or servers, for functions such as advertising pop-ups or banners on the page you’re viewing.

Necessary cookies

Necessary cookies are either session or persistent cookies, and can be delivered by a first or third party. These cookies perform functions such as keeping your site visit secure and remembering you between pages, for example when you navigate from page to page in a NetBank session. Access to certain parts of commbank.com.au depends on these types of cookies.

Functional cookies

Functional cookies can be either session or persistent cookies, and can be delivered by a first or third party. They remember information such as usernames or language settings and may allow the site to display important alerts. These cookies aren’t considered necessary, and can be blocked by the user, although this may impact how the site functions. In some instances, functional cookies are used by the CommBank website to provide customers applying from certain pages special offers.

Tracking and social cookies

These cookies can be either session or persistent cookies, and are delivered by a first or third party. They’re not essential for the function of the website, but may improve experience by providing content relevant to you and your interests.

Some of the cookies that the CommBank website uses are essential for protecting our customers’ financial and personal information.

From time to time our web pages contain special offers and we may use cookies to provide customers with these offers. This requires you to have cookies enabled to ensure these cookies are stored on your computer when applying.
