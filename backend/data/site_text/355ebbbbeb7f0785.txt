Dispute checklist

                                    I don’t recognise the transaction

To determine if there’s an unauthorised or fraudulent transaction on your account, first check:

Was the purchase made by a family member or any other cardholder authorised to use the account?

Could the merchant be trading under a 
different name
?

Was the transaction made in a foreign currency and converted into Australian dollars?

Is the transaction a regular membership, subscription fee or app download?

To review in more detail, click on the transaction in the 
CommBank app
 or 
NetBank
, as it may be under a different date/time or business name. You can also ‘ask about this transaction’ using 
Ceba
 who can see if similar transactions have been made on your account and guide you. 

                                    I have an issue with something I’ve purchased

You may be able to raise a dispute with us if;

You’ve been charged multiple times for the same purchase

You were charged the wrong amount for your purchase

You didn’t receive the goods and/or services you paid for

The goods and/or services you paid for weren’t as described, or defective

However, a dispute cannot be raised for the following issues, and only the business can resolve:

Refunds or exchanges if you change your mind

Membership or monthly subscription enquiries

Issues with software you've downloaded

                                    Should I contact the merchant?

For any of the above issues, it’s useful to get in contact with the merchant you purchased from and document the discussion, as this can help us address your dispute faster.

You should also gather receipts, photographs of the item if it’s not as described, and the business’ contact details, as we may ask you for supporting documentation. 

                                    How can I keep my accounts safe in the meantime?

For extra control and security, put a temporary lock on your 
debit card 
or 
credit card
. For Corporate Cards, you can contact 
13 1576
 to temporarily block or permanently stop your card account.

To continue making payments, if you have an Everyday Account, you can use 
Cardless Cash
 in the CommBank app to make ATM cash withdrawals. And if you’re already set up with a digital wallet, you can still use your phone to make payments more securely.

What happens when you contact us

For unauthorised transactions, we'll have to cancel your card to protect your account from further fraudulent activity and send you a new one. Since we’re cancelling your card, you may need to review any scheduled payments and organise to have them paid from a different account

For unauthorised transactions relating to digital fraud and scams, we’ll have to lock your NetBank to protect your account from further fraudulent activity. Please visit our 
digital fraud
 and 
scam
 pages for more information.

Getting a resolution

We’ll keep you updated

Once you’ve contacted us to raise a dispute, you can expect the following from us:

We’ll work hard to resolve your issue as quickly as possible

We'll either send you a letter or email confirming the outcome of our investigation

If you have the CommBank app, you’ll receive notifications about your dispute

How long will it take?

In addition to the time taken for any pending transactions to be processed so we can initiate a dispute:

Quick decision (3 business days)
 – We endeavour to resolve most disputes within 3 business days, which is when you should see the money back in your account if your dispute is successful

Further investigation (21 calendar days)
 – How long it takes to resolve a dispute depends on the complexity of the dispute and whether a merchant decides to challenge your claim. Some dispute investigations can take 21 calendar days, and we’ll contact you if it is any longer
5

Resolution of your dispute 

If successful, we'll credit the account your dispute was raised from. If that’s closed, we’ll ask you for the details of an alternative account.

The credit will appear as at the date the disputed transaction was processed. For example, if it was in pending and then processed on 5 February, your credit will appear as at 5 February, not the date you raised the dispute with us or the date your dispute was resolved.

We reserve the right to reverse a refund on reasonable grounds; for example, if the merchant provides sufficient evidence that you should be liable for the transaction, or if we identify you’ve received a duplicate refund. We’ll notify you in writing after we have reverse the funds, which can happen up to 45 calendar days after you receive your refund. If reversing these funds causes you hardship, please 
contact us
.

Things you should know

1
 This doesn’t apply to an unauthorised transaction that’s regulated by the 
ePayments Code
.

2

Digital and mobile wallets
 (e.g. CBA Tap & Pay, Apple Pay) allow you to make payments with your digital device while hiding your card info from stores and merchants. Adding your card to a digital wallet encrypts the card number replacing it with a token number instead. This means your card isn’t stored on the device or ever shared with you when you process your payment.

 The CommBank app is free to download however your mobile network provider charges you for accessing data on your phone.

Find out about the minimum operating requirements on the 
CommBank app page
