Got questions? We’ve got answers

                                    What is a personal loan and when is it preferred?

A personal loan is a type of loan where you can borrow a certain amount of money to use for almost any personal expense and you’ll repay it over time with interest. They are typically used for large purchases like cars, renovations, or debt consolidation.

                                    How much can I borrow with a personal loan?

Loan amounts typically range from $4,000 to $120,000, depending on the lender and the type of personal loan you’re looking to apply for.

                                    What are the most common reasons people take out personal loans?

Top reasons include buying a new or used car, debt consolidation, home improvements, unexpected expenses, holidays, and living expenses.

                                    What’s the difference between a secured and unsecured personal loan?

Secured personal loans are backed by an asset (e.g. the car you’re buying). This also means you can typically borrow at a lower interest rate.

Unsecured personal loans are not backed by any asset. This usually means the borrowing process is simpler, but the loan usually has higher interest rates than a secured personal loan.

                                    Can I get my personal loan refinanced?

Yes, you can refinance a personal loan. Refinancing involves taking out a new loan to pay off your existing one, ideally with better terms such as a lower interest rate, reduced monthly repayments, or a more flexible repayment schedule. It can also be a useful way to consolidate multiple debts into a single loan.

                                    Will applying for a personal loan affect my credit score?

Yes, it can impact your credit score in either a positive or negative way. Being mindful about your applications and managing your credit responsibly can help keep your score healthy. However, if you submit multiple applications in a short period or frequently miss your loan repayments, it could have a negative effect. Some lenders, such as CommBank, provide you with the ability to check your rates upfront, prior to submitting your application. This won't have any impact to your credit score.
