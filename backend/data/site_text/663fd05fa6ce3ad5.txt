The CommBank Neo Business card, Low Rate credit card, Interest-Free Days credit card, Business Awards credit card and Business Platinum Awards credit card are personal liability business credit cards. By applying, you (the individual that is applying for a Business credit card) acknowledge that the business credit card you are applying for provides for personal liability. We will look to you (and no any company, partnership or other business entity that may employ or engage you) to recover all amounts charged using the Business credit card, including any amounts charged by an additional cardholder.

The Corporate Interest-Free Days card, Corporate Low Rate card and Corporate charge card are business liability cards. Business liability means the business, not an individual, is liable for all transactions made on the cards.
