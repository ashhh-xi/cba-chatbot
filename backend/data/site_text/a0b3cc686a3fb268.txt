What are phishing and SMiShing scams?

Phishing is when a scammer sends an email that appears to be from a trusted source, often including an urgent ‘call to action’ like asking you to unlock or verify an account, log on to your bank accounts or make a payment immediately. 

SMiShing is a type of phishing where the message is sent via SMS text message rather than email.

Once you click on the link or open the attachment, you may be asked to enter your personal information such as such as card numbers, NetBank client number, banking passwords and NetCodes. Malware could also be installed on your device or you might receive a call where scammers attempt to convince you to share personal or banking details with them.

Scammers may use this information to access your bank accounts to make payments online, register for a new CommBank app or activate digital wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay.

If you’re worried you’ve clicked on a link in a scam message, follow these quick instructions on 
how to contact us and what you can do to protect yourself

Tips to stay safe

Stay vigilant:

Always question any SMS that has a link, even messages from familiar companies under the same contact or message thread

Scammers use clever tactics to trick you into clicking on links and providing personal details, so take your time to review the message

If the SMS is asking for payment or personal details, verify the request on an authenticated platform, like the company’s genuine website you search yourself or an authenticated application

If you’re ever unsure whether an email, message or phone call is legitimately from CommBank, please 
message us
 in the CommBank app,  call us on 13 22 21 or visit us in a branch so we can assist you

Protect your accounts:

Review your accounts and transaction history regularly for unusual or unauthorised transactions

Change your passwords regularly and don’t share them with anyone

If possible, enable two-factor authentication or biometrics, such as Face ID, to log into accounts

Stop

Does a call, email or text seem off? The best thing to do is stop. Take a breath. Real organisations won’t put you under pressure to act instantly.

Check

Ask someone you trust or contact the organisation the message claims to be from.

Reject

If you’re unsure, delete the email or text and block the phone number. Change your passwords.
