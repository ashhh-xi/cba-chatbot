A Guide to Cat and Dog Vaccinations

A guide to cat and dog vaccination schedules 

Vaccinations can protect your pets from common diseases.

Following a recommended vaccination schedule, from your vet, can help you stay on track and look after your pet’s health.

Ensuring your pets are healthy and up to date with their vaccinations is crucial for their health and wellbeing, and to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. This guide explains why it’s important to keep your pets protected against common diseases. It also provides an overview on the different types of vaccinations for dogs and cats and the recommended vaccination schedules.

Why are vaccinations important?

Bringing your pet to the vet may not always be easy, but skipping a vaccination can put your pet’s health at risk.

Pet vaccinations are vital because they protect your pets from a range of potential diseases. For example, dog vaccines can prevent parvovirus or distemper, while cat vaccines can prevent diseases like feline leukemia virus and calicivirus. These diseases are highly contagious and sometimes fatal.

On top of improving your pet’s health, vaccinating your pet also contributes to the wellbeing of the pet community, by reducing the spread of infectious diseases.

Why you should follow a vaccination schedule

Staying on track with your pet’s vaccinations is important for keeping them protected. One way to ensure you don’t miss a vaccine is by following a puppy vaccination schedule or dog vaccination schedule from your vet.

Recommended dog vaccination schedule

Welcoming a new puppy into your home is an exciting time, but it also comes with important responsibilities.

Puppy vaccinations

6 to 8 weeks old - first vaccination. 

10 to 12 weeks old – second vaccination.

14 to 16 weeks old – third vaccination.

Annual vaccinations

There are several options for adult dog booster vaccinations, referred to as:

C3, also known as the ‘core’ vaccination, protects your dog from parvovirus, distemper and hepatitis.

C4 contains the C3 vaccines along with parainfluenza, which is a viral type of ‘kennel cough’.

C5 contains C4 along with Bordetella, the bacterial type of ‘kennel cough’.

These annual vaccinations are recommended but optional - based on your local area and routine, your dog’s breed, how often your dog is around other canines, and other health factors. 

Please consult your local vet to determine which optional vaccinations are appropriate for your puppy or dog, based on their lifestyle, environment, breed and health status. 

Recommended cat vaccination schedule

Kitten vaccinations

6 to 8 weeks old - first vaccination. 

10 to 12 weeks old – second vaccination.

14 to 16 weeks old – third vaccination.

1 year following third vaccination - first adult booster vaccination.

Annual vaccinations

F3 vaccine for cat – which includes protection against three core diseases: herpesvirus, Calicivirus, and Panleukopenia (feline distemper)

Optional vaccinations

There are several optional vaccinations available for cats. Their relevance to your kitten/cat will depend on your family’s and/or cat’s circumstances, including such things as where you live, if they're an indoor or outdoor cat, and other lifestyle factors. 

For cats, these optional vaccinations include

Feline immunodeficiency virus;

Feline chlamydia; and

Feline leukemia.

Please consult your local vet to determine which optional vaccinations are appropriate for your cat, based on their lifestyle, environment, breed and health status. 

Tips for taking care of your pets after a vaccination

It’s important to give extra care to your pet post-vaccination, and to watch for any signs of discomfort. Some considerations for post-vaccination care include:

Limit activity
: Let your pet rest and avoid strenuous activities for 24 hours.

Provide comfort
: Ensure a quiet, comfortable place with plenty of water and their usual food.

Avoid stress
: Keep your pet in a calm, familiar environment.

Check injection site
: Look for redness, swelling, or discharge. 

Limit socialisation
: From when a pet enters your care until a period following their final vaccination (10 days for kittens and 14 days for puppies) your pet should be isolated from other cats or dogs to prevent the spread of diseases before the vaccine has time to settle. The exception to this rule is if you have a pet already at home and they are up to date on their vaccinations, then it is safe for them to interact with your new family member.

If you notice any discomfort in your pet, you should always reach out to your vet.

Can you claim vaccination costs through pet insurance?

You may be able to claim vaccination costs depending on your specific policy. It’s always best to read your policy documents (Product Disclosure Statement) and check with your pet insurance provider, to confirm what’s covered under your plan.

If you ever have questions about your pet’s health and vaccinations, don’t hesitate to use the 24/7 Live Vet support chat service (complimentary for customers who hold a Pet Insurance policy with CBA)
