Offer commenced 1 March 2025 and is only available on new Low Fee credit cards applied for. Offer not available to customers who currently hold, or have held, any activated Low Fee or Low Rate card types in the 18 months prior as a primary cardholder or customers who switch from other card types.

 You won't be able to apply for an instalment plan if you don't meet our criteria (e.g. if you have exceeded your limit or you are in default). Instalment plans are not available on CommBank Neo, non-Awards Business Cards, corporate cards or balance transfers. The terms of the 
CommBank Credit Card Conditions of Use
 relating to instalment plans (section 5) will apply.

While you have an instalment plan, payments to your credit card will be applied in the following order:

Current monthly instalments, starting with interest and instalment setup fee, if applicable

Your non-instalment-plan balances

Your remaining instalment balances

This means that your current monthly instalment payments are always paid first, even if you have other balances with higher interest rates (such as cash advances or purchases not in a plan). If you have multiple plans, payments will be applied to the plans in order of highest to lowest interest rate, or if all plan interest rates are the same, from oldest to newest.

Any interest-free period on purchases will no longer apply once the purchase is put on a plan.

You can cancel your instalment plan at any time. When a cancellation is processed, the outstanding instalment balance will be transferred to your purchases balance (or cash advance balance for cancelled cash advance plans) and accrue interest from the transfer date at your account’s standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed from when you first set up your SurePay plan.

If you miss a monthly instalment payment, the unpaid instalment amount for that month will be returned to your main balance and you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate, which may have changed from when you first set up your SurePay plan. If you cancel a plan this will also apply to any outstanding balance.

If you miss three consecutive payments we’ll automatically cancel your SurePay plan. You won’t be charged a fee if your plan is cancelled – however any outstanding balance will be transferred back to your purchase (or cash advance) rate and added to the total owing on your latest statement on the cancellation date. From the transfer date, you’ll be charged interest at your accounts standard purchase (or cash advance) rate. Please refer to your most recent statement to confirm your card's current interest rate as this may have changed since you first set up your SurePay plan.

SurePay Purchase Plan terms and conditions

To pay off a one-off purchase of $100 or more, made in the last 14 days with a 0% p.a. interest rate for a fee of 2% for 3 month plans, 3% for 6 month plans and 5% for 12 month plans.

Minimum transaction amount per term: $100 for 3 months, $150 for 6 months and $300 for 12 months.

Your monthly plan repayment is calculated by dividing the total plan amount (including the set-up fee), by the number of months in the plan term. The set-up fee is included as part of your first Monthly Instalment Payment, and when you make your first repayment, the repayment will be used first towards paying off the set-up fee, then towards the purchase amount. The fee is non-refundable if you cancel or pay off your plan early.

The 0% p.a. interest rate is only available for ‘Card purchase plans’ and not ‘Card balance plans’ or ‘Cash advance balance plans’.
