Things you should know

1
 Lock, Block, Limit doesn't apply to transactions that are flagged as recurring (e.g. direct debits) and transactions not sent to us for authorisation. Except for the spending cap, transactions made via Tap & Pay set up on a compatible smartphone aren't blocked. Some transactions made at CommBank branches, over the phone, through online or mobile banking (including transfers to other accounts, bill payments and assisted cash withdrawals) are also excluded. Other conditions apply. 

2
 You won't be able to apply for an instalment plan if you don't meet our criteria (e.g. if you have exceeded your limit or you are in default). Instalment plans are not available on CommBank Neo, non-Awards Business Cards, corporate cards or balance transfers. The terms of the 
CommBank Credit Card Conditions of Use
 relating to instalment plans (section 5) will apply. 

While you have an instalment plan, we apply your credit card payments first to your current monthly instalments. This will apply even when you have other card balances with a higher interest rate, such as cash advances and purchases not on a plan. 

Any interest-free period on purchases will no longer apply once the purchase is put on a plan. 

You can cancel your instalment plan at any time. When a cancellation is processed, the outstanding instalment balance will be transferred to your purchases balance and accrue interest from the transfer date at the standard purchase interest rate applicable on your account. 

If you miss a monthly instalment payment, the unpaid instalment amount for that month will be returned to your main balance and charged interest at the standard purchase rate.  

If you fail to make your monthly instalments on your SurePay instalment plan for three consecutive months, we’ll cancel the SurePay instalment plan. Any remaining SurePay instalment balance and any interest on the cancelled plan will be transferred to your purchase balance and will be payable at the card purchase interest rate . 

SurePay Purchase Plan terms and conditions 

To pay off a one-off purchase of $100 or more, made in the last 14 days with a 0% p.a. interest rate for a fee of 2% for 3 month plans, 3% for 6 month plans and 5% for 12 month plans.

Minimum transaction amount per term: $100 for 3 months, $150 for 6 months and $300 for 12 months.

Your monthly plan repayment is calculated by dividing the total plan amount (including the set-up fee), by the number of months in the plan term. The set-up fee is included as part of your first Monthly Instalment Payment, and when you make your first repayment, the repayment will be used first towards paying off the set-up fee, then towards the purchase amount. The fee is non-refundable if you cancel or pay off your plan early.

The 0% p.a. interest rate is only available for 'Card purchase plans' and not 'Card balance plans' or 'Cash advance balance plans'.
