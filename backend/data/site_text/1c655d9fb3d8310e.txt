Protect yourself from scams

During this time, customers should also remain vigilant and be extra cautious of unexpected calls or messages claiming to be from well-known organisations including banks, telecommunications companies and government agencies.   

How customers can better protect themselves from scams: 

Stop:

Does a call, email or text seem off? The best thing to do is stop. Take a breath.  Real organisations won’t put you under pressure to act instantly. 

Check:

Ask someone you trust or contact the organisation the message claims to be from. 

Reject:

If you’re unsure, hang up on the caller, delete the email, block the phone number.  

Change your passwords. 

Beware of SMS & email scams after a natural disaster

Remember, we’ll never send you an SMS or email that:

requests an excess payment to progress your insurance claim

asks for your NetBank Client ID

asks for your password

asks you to share a NetCode with us

includes a link to login directly from the SMS or email

Always type commbank.com.au into a browser or use the CommBank app to securely access your banking.

If you think you might have been impacted by a scam, you should 
report it right away
.
