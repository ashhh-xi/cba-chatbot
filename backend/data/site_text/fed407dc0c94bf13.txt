Any existing medical conditions?

Why this is important

You and anyone travelling with you needs the reassurance that you’re protected, no matter what. That includes claims directly or indirectly relating to an existing medical condition.

Let’s debunk a myth - being honest about a medical condition doesn’t always mean you can’t get travel insurance.

It pays to be upfront when you answer this, give Cover-More a call if you’re not sure. 

What’s listed?

Many conditions can be automatically included on your activated policy provided you and your condition meet the specified criteria.

Conditions include:

Asthma

Gout

Hay Fever

Coeliac Disease

High Blood Pressure

High Cholesterol

For a full list of conditions and criteria (including pregnancy), check our 
Credit Card Insurances Product Disclosure Statement
 (PDF) or 
World Debit Mastercard insurances Product Disclosure Statement and Information Booklet
 (PDF). 

Mine’s not there. Now what?

If all of your existing medical conditions or your travel companion’s conditions aren’t automatically included, you’ll need to complete an online health assessment as part of activating your travel insurance or call 1300 467 951 for help.

You’ll instantly know if they’re covered. If approved, you’ll need to pay an additional premium to cover your existing medical condition.

80 or over?

If you’re 80 or over, you must apply for Upgrades cover. Check our 
Credit Card Insurances Product Disclosure Statement
 (PDF) or 
World Debit Mastercard insurances Product Disclosure Statement and Information Booklet
 (PDF) for more information.
