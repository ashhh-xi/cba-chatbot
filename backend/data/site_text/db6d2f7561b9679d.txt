Support for customers with a home loan

Variable rate customers:

Small changes now can make a big difference later to how much of your home loan you end up repaying – and how long it takes.

See how you can 
pay off your loan sooner
.

If you’re ahead on your loan, you may be able to access available money in 
redraw
 to use towards other expenses or apply for a 
repayment holiday
, which allows you to put future Direct Debit Request (DDR) repayments on hold for a set period between three to 12 months. 

If you have an eligible Variable Rate home loan or investment home loan you can also use available money in your Everyday Offset towards your living expenses.

FAQs

Why have my required repayment amounts increased?

Your minimum required repayment may have increased because one or more of the following things have happened:

The interest rate for your home loan has increased. View our 
customer support page
 for our latest rate change information

Your fixed-term, interest-only or introductory interest rate period has ended, so the interest rate used to calculate your repayment amount has changed

You’ve taken money out of your available redraw balance.

If I have an existing collections or hardship arrangement, does this impact my existing arrangements?

If we’ve agreed to a payment deferral or for you to pay less than your minimum payment, please continue to comply with the agreed terms. We’ll contact you at the end of your current arrangement and work with you in light of this change to your minimum required repayment amount.

If you’re paying your minimum repayments plus extra to clear any arrears, you’ll need to pay the increased minimum repayment plus the extra to clear the arrears in the agreed time. If you’re unable to do so, please contact us and we will amend your payment arrangement so that we can continue to support you.

If you have any questions around your agreed payment arrangement, please call 
13 30 95
 between 8am and 9pm Monday to Friday or 9am to 2pm Saturday (Sydney time).

Things you should know

An Everyday offset is a transaction account linked to your eligible variable rate home loan or investment home loan. Money you put into your Everyday Offset reduces the balance on which we charge interest.

Applications are subject to credit approval. Full terms and conditions will be included in our loan offer. Fees and charges are payable. Interest rates are subject to change.

As this advice has been prepared without considering your objectives, financial situation or needs, you should consider its appropriateness to your circumstances before acting on this advice.
