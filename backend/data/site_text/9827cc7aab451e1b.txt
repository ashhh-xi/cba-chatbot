Dog food guide: What dog owners should know about the options available 

Dog food guide: What dog owners should know

There are many types of dog food with varying benefits and considerations. 

Consider your dog’s life stage, breed and any dietary requirements when choosing their dog food. 

Consult your vet if you have any questions about your dog’s diet. 

Choosing the right food for your dog can be overwhelming, with so many options available. That’s why we’ve put together this handy guide on different types of dog food, and things to keep in mind when feeding your dog. Whether you’re a new or seasoned owner, you’ll find these tips helpful for keeping your furry friend well fed.

Types of dog food

Here is a summary of the main dog food options:

Raw dog food

What it is: 
uncooked, minimally processed meals e.g. (meat, bones, organs).

Benefits:
 mimics a natural diet, potential to improve coat health and digestion.

Considerations:
 bacterial contamination, preparation required and a need to review the nutritional balance.

Best suited for:
 dogs with active lifestyles or a specific dietary requirement.

Fresh dog food

What it is:
 lightly cooked meals with human-grade ingredients, served fresh or thawed from frozen.

Benefits:
 complete nutrition without preservatives, preparation required and a need to review the nutritional balance.

Considerations:
 can cost more than other options and ingredients may have shorter shelf life.

Dry dog food

What it is:
 shelf stable, processed kibble.

Benefits:
 cheaper than raw and fresh food, convenient to serve.

Considerations:
 less hydrating than raw or fresh food, can be less nutritional.

Tip: 
look for high protein content when selecting a dry food option for nutritional value. 

Canned dog food

What it is:
 Moist, often meat-based food that comes in cans or pouches.

Benefits:
 Highly palatable, easy to digest, and contains higher moisture content.

Considerations:
 Can be more expensive than dry food and has a shorter shelf life once opened.

Best suited for: 
Dogs that need extra hydration or have difficulty chewing dry food.

Commercial vs homemade dog food

Store-bought commercial dog food meets regulatory standards but may contain fillers and preservatives. On the flip side, home-made dog food gives you more control over the ingredients but requires planning to ensure you’re providing a complete and balanced diet for your pup.

Considerations for choosing dog food

Here are a few factors to consider when choosing dog food:

Age

Puppies:
 benefit from high protein, fat and calcium for growth. Look for formulas labelled ‘growth’ or ‘all life stages’

Adults:
 balanced diet for weight maintenance, avoid excess calories unless your dog is very active

Senior:
 lower calorie options, foods that easily digestible

Breed & size

Small (e.g Chihuahuas):
 may require smaller kibble and more frequent meals due to their higher metabolism

Medium (e. g. Labrador):
 balanced diet unless there are dietary requirements

Large (e.g Great Dane):
 foods high in calcium to support joint health and prevent bone issues

Activity level

Low: 
lower calorie options to prevent obesity

Medium:
 a balanced diet

High:
 high protein and fat for energy

While these are some general considerations, remember that every dog is different. For example, any health conditions like allergies or diabetes could mean that your dog will require a specialised diet.

How often should you feed your dog

Feeding frequency can depend on your dog’s age and health. For example:

Puppies:
 may need three to four meals a day, to support this rapid growth phase

Adults: 
fed once or twice daily depending on size and activity

Seniors:
 may benefit from smaller, more frequent meals to aid digestion and improve energy levels

Remember to review the instructions on the food packaging but be prepared to adjust based on your dog’s individual needs.

When your dog is recovering from a bug or illness, it’s always best to steer towards smaller meals and easily digestible foods.

When should you consult the vet for your dog’s diet?

Regular checkups can ensure your dog’s diet remains balanced and suitable for their needs. Here’s a few scenarios where you may wish to visit the vet:

Your dog has a health condition or dietary restrictions

You notice a change in your dog’s weight, appetite or energy levels

You’re considering a major change in your dog’s diet, such as switching to a raw or home-cooked diet

Your dog has allergies

You need advice on portion sizes and feeding schedules

Choosing the right dog food involves considering your dog's age, breed, activity level, and any specific dietary needs, to ensure they stay healthy and happy.
