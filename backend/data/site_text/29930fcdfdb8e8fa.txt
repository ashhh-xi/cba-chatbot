FAQs

                                    1. Why does the CommBank app look different to the last time I logged in?

We’ve updated the app to make it safer and easier to do your banking.

                                    2. Can I remove the app update?

You won’t be able to access the old app version once it’s updated. We understand that it can take some time to get used to the new version, but you can use the search bar to find anything you need if you get stuck.

                                    3. Why am I not seeing the app update?

We’re progressively rolling out the app update over the next two weeks. To update the app yourself, go to Google Play or the App Store, search for the CommBank app, and tap ‘Update’.

                                    4. Where do I find the log off button?

You can still log out of the CommBank app whenever you like. Simply click into your profile in the top-left corner and then tap the ‘Log off’ button. The CommBank app will be automatically logged out after 15 minutes of leaving the app or earlier, depending on the auto-log off settings chosen in the app.
