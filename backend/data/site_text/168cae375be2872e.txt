 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 15 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25 year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5 year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed or guaranteed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed or guaranteed period. During an interest only period, your interest only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.

Applications for finance are subject to the Bank’s normal credit approval. Full terms and conditions are included in the Loan Offer. Other fees and charges are payable.
