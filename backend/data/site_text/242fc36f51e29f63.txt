Earn up to 1.5 Awards points or 0.6 Qantas Points per $1 spent at major Australian supermarkets, department stores, petrol stations, dining (cafes, restaurants, fast food & delivery services) and utilities (electricity, gas and water only).

They will appear on your credit card statement under the ‘Awards Transactions’ section.

How Ultimate Awards points work:

Earn up to 3 Awards points or 1.2 Qantas Points per $1 spent on international transactions. International transactions include any purchase you make overseas or when shopping online from Australia if the merchant or entity who processes the payment is based overseas.
