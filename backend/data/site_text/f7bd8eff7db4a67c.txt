What is a settlement account?

A settlement account is linked to your trading account. It acts as an investment wallet, allowing you to pay for or receive money from your trades.

For example, when you buy $100 worth of shares at a cost of $5 (brokerage), $105 will be debited from your settlement account. This process is called T+2 settlement, which takes place two business days after a trade.

When you sell shares, the funds from the sale of your shares, less any brokerage costs, will be deposited into your nominated settlement account.

The Commonwealth Direct Investment Account (CDIA) is the preferred cash management account for CommSec share traders.

You can use a CDIA as your settlement account for your 
CommSec Share Trading
 account or your 
CommSec Pocket ETFs
 account.

                                    Can I have more than one CDIA?

Yes. You can have more than one CDIA  for different purposes, for example you can choose to have a CDIA for share trading and a separate CDIA set up for a SMSF. While you can create multiple CDIAs under your CommSec profile, accounts that are outside of the Target Market Determination (TMD) may be closed in accordance with the 
Transaction, Savings and Investment Accounts (TSIA) Terms and Conditions
.

                                    Can I link one CDIA to multiple trading accounts?

Yes, you can link your CDIA to multiple CommSec trading accounts as long as the CDIA is in the same name as the trading account. 

                                    Will my CDIA appear in my CommBank app and Netbank?

Yes. You can access your CDIA and make transactions in NetBank and the CommBank app. Once you have logged in using your NetBank ID, you can also switch to CommSec and navigate easily between both sites. This means you can take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise and access your cash instantly to settle trades.

                                    Why do I need to provide a Tax File Number for a CDIA?

Without a valid TFN or a TFN exemption applied to your Commonwealth Direct Investment Account (CDIA), you may be subject to withholding tax from any interest earned on your account/s.

To provide your TFN for your CDIA, you’ll need to log on to Netbank. You can access NetBank from your CommSec account by selecting the NetBank tab in the top left corner of your screen. Once you’re logged on to Netbank, go to Settings, then select ‘Tax file number’ under Profile.

For entity account types including SMSF, Company and Trust, please contact the Commonwealth Bank on 13 1998 or visit your local branch to update your TFN details.

If you wish to provide your TFN for share trading purposes, you'll need to provide it directly to the relevant share registry.

                                    Is there a minimum balance required in my CDIA?

No, there’s no minimum balance requirement for a CDIA opened through CommSec.

                                    What are the interest rates for a CDIA?

Interest earned on your CDIA is calculated daily and credited to your account on the first calendar day of each month. For CDIAs opened before 1 November 2012, interest is credited quarterly.

You can also 
check the current interest rate applicable to your CDIA
 on NetBank, or by calling the Commonwealth Bank on 13 22 21.
