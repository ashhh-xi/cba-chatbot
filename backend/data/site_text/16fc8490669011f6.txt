Credit card statements

 Understanding credit card statements

Your statement is designed to help you find the most important information, review your transactions and see our latest offers.

                        Standard statement

                        Instalment plan statement

Your account summary

Your statement summary: shows your opening balance, new transactions and charges, closing balance and any payments or refunds for your statement period.

Your general credit card account details: includes your statement period, credit limit and available credit. If you have a CommBank Awards credit card, you’ll also see how many Awards points you have.

Your payment summary: shows the total amount owing for the month (also known as your closing balance), minimum payment and when your payment is due.

Repayments & offers

Minimum repayment warning: this table illustrates how long it will take you to pay off your balance including any applicable interest charges by paying only the minimum payment versus the saving you would make by paying more than the minimum payment over a 2 year period. You can also find details to contact us if you’re 
experiencing financial difficulty
.

At the bottom of your statement, we’ll keep you up to date with special offers and handy credit card tips.
