 Comparison rate calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25-year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for variable Interest Only loans are based on an initial 5-year Interest Only period. Comparison rates for fixed Interest Only loans are based on an initial Interest Only period equal in length to the fixed period. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.

~
 We charge the Rate Lock Fee when we process your request. It is therefore important that you have sufficient funds in your nominated account. The Rate Lock feature only applies to new Fixed Rate home loan and Fixed Rate Investment home loan applications. Rate Lock does not apply to Home Seekers, switching, splitting, top-ups, loan purpose transfers or repayment changes. 

#
 You can choose to pay Principal and Interest weekly, fortnightly, or monthly. Only monthly payments are available for Interest Only. The maximum Interest Only payment period over the life of a loan is 15 years for Investment Home Loans and 5 years for Owner Occupied Home Loans, so long as there is at least 5 years remaining on the Contracted Loan Term. We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only payments or Principal and Interest repayments. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments won't reduce your loan balance unless you choose to make additional repayments. At the end of an Interest Only period, your repayments will increase to cover Principal and Interest components.

Information provided (including interest rates) are subject to change.

Calculations are estimates provided as a guide only and are not a loan approval. They assume interest rates don’t change over the life of the loan and are calculated on the rate that applies for the initial period of the loan. They do not take into account fees, charges or other amounts that may be charged to your loan (such as establishment or monthly service fees or stamp duty).
 Interest rates referenced are current rates and may change at any time.

Lenders' Mortgage Insurance
 or a 
Low Deposit Premium
 may apply to your loan depending on the size of your deposit; security, applicant and loan attributes. This is a one-off cost and will be added to the loan amount. Any of these additional amounts will increase repayments under the loan.

We have different rates that apply, depending on whether you are making Interest Only (IO) payments or principal and interest repayments. During an IO period, your IO payments won't reduce your loan balance. At the end of an IO period, your repayments will increase to cover principal and interest components.

Applications are subject to credit approval, satisfactory security and minimum deposit requirements. Conditions apply to all loan options. Full terms and conditions will be set out in our loan offer, if an offer is made. Fees and charges are payable. Interest rates are subject to change. As this advice has been prepared without considering your objectives, financial situation or needs, you should consider its appropriateness to your circumstances before acting on the advice.
