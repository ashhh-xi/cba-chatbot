Financial Services Guides

Before you access and read a PDS or Terms and Conditions brochure, you should read the Financial Services Guide (FSG). FSGs are intended to inform you about the product provider and the services they provide, before they provide you with financial advice. Note that some products, such as Home Loans and Credit Cards, do not have a FSG.

Product Disclosure Statements

A Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) or Terms and Conditions brochure is a document (or group of documents) which describe a financial product or service, including the features, benefits, cost and risks associated with that product.

This page provides you with access to PDSs or Terms and Conditions which are currently available electronically for products of the Commonwealth Bank Group, along with the relevant Financial Services Guide
