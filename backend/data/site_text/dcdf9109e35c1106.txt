Introducing Amber

Amber is an energy retailer and smart tech company rolled into one. For a simple monthly subscription fee, through the Amber app, you can access cheaper energy prices by shifting your usage from peak periods to times of the day when there are more renewables available in the grid.

With the Amber app, you’ll be able to view both a 12-hour price forecast and a live price tracker, so you can plan your energy use. You’ll also be able to monitor your usage and savings, so you stay on top of your monthly bill.

Own a home battery? Or thinking about buying one?

Shifting your usage isn’t the only way you could save money and help power a more energy efficient Australia. If you’re a solar and battery owner (or thinking of becoming one), the 
Amber for Batteries platform
 will automate your system in line with wholesale pricing.

You’ll be using power and topping up your battery from the grid at times when energy is cheaper and there are more renewables available. Amber’s SmartShift technology automates discharging and selling back to the grid, so you can get the full upside of your exports when demand is peaking. You can also view how your battery is being optimised and how much it’s saving you by using the Amber app.

Eligibility for CommBank Yello Offers

To redeem this once-off CommBank Yello offer (refer to the offer table above to determine which offer you are eligible for), sign-up to Amber by clicking ‘
Sign Up
’, use your unique offer code provided by CommBank via the CommBank Yello hub in your CommBank App, add your CommBank Credit Card, Debit Card or bank account as your Amber online account payment method, and meet all other eligibility requirements including:

Offer available to eligible customers who complete signup by 30 June 2026 in areas where Amber is available, including NSW, Victoria, SA, ACT and southeast Queensland.

Customers who have held an Amber account at any time between 4 June 2024 and 3 June 2025 are not eligible for this offer.

Offer is for CommBank Yello customers who meet each of the eligibility criteria in the 
CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions
 that are either part of the CommBank Yello, Plus, Gold, or Diamond tier. See full 
CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions
 for more information. The CommBank Yello Terms and Conditions and eligibility criteria may be subject to change.  

Any unique offer codes not redeemed by 30 June 2026 will expire. Limit of one code per customer. If you cease to meet the eligibility criteria for the CommBank Yello,  Plus, Gold or Diamond tier (as outlined in the CommBank Yello T&Cs) at any time while you are receiving a discount under this offer, you will continue to receive any remaining portion of the 12 month discount as long as you continue to use an eligible CommBank online payment method.

You must continue to use a CommBank credit card, debit card or bank account to maintain the discounts available with this offer. If during the 12 months promotional period you switch your payment method to a non-CommBank account, or your CommBank card expires, you will forfeit any remaining discounted months.  Access to the offer will be revoked with effect from the following month.

You are free to cancel at any time without charge, however cancelling your service within the offer period forfeits any remaining discounted months.

Should you relocate address during the promotional period, the offer is transferable to your new address.

This offer is not valid in conjunction with any other offer or discount.‍   ￼  The promo code is unique and aligns to a customer’s specific CommBank Yello tier. (i.e. a CommBank Yello Plus unique offer code can only be used to redeem the CommBank Yello Plus offer, even if you pass the offer code onto another CommBank customer who may be on a different CommBank Yello tier).

Customers are able to gift CommBank Yello promo codes to other CommBank customers. To ensure the credit is applied, all customers must comply with these eligibility requirements.

You may sign up one additional property with Amber (e.g. your holiday house) and claim this offer for that property but to do so you must use a different sign-up email address. Offer strictly limited to two properties only and not valid if you choose to leave Amber and return during the offer period.

Customers can move between CommBank Yello tiers, but will not be able to move to a different offer once the offer has been redeemed.

The provision of your service will be subject to Amber’s standard terms of service and policies, available at 
www.amber.com.au/terms
.

Offers limited. Amber and CommBank reserves the right to remove this offer at any time.
